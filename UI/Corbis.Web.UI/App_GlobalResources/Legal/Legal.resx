    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

                                    or to the public or in any online or other electronic distribution system.
                                    Except for this limited, internal testing and sample use, Corbis grants
                                    you no other rights, and you may not copy, distribute, publish, display,

                                    of Goods, the application of which is expressly disclaimed. The parties
                                    hereto confirm that it is their wish that this Agreement, as well as
                                    any other documents relating hereto, including notices, has been and
                                    shall be written in the English language. In any dispute between Corbis

                                Miscellaneous 
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and understand it, and
                                    agree to be bound by all its terms and conditions. This Agreement (along
                                    with Corbis’ Privacy Policy and the Corbis Content License Agreement,
                                    if applicable) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
                                    respect to the subject matter hereof and merges all prior and contemporaneous
                                    communications. No action of Corbis, other than the express or written
                                    waiver or amendment, may be construed as a waiver or amendment of this
                                    Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a written agreement
                                    signed by duly authorized representatives of Corbis, provided that no
                                    purchase order or similar document issued by you shall modify this Agreement,
                                    even if signed by Corbis. If any provision of this Agreement is found
                                    invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain
                                    valid and enforceable according to its terms. The parties intend that
                                    the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permitted
                                    by applicable law. Accordingly, the parties agree that if any provisions
                                    are deemed not enforceable, they shall be deemed modified to the extent
                                    necessary to make them enforceable and in such manner as comes closest
                                    to the intentions of the parties to this Agreement as is possible. This
                                    Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties,
                                    their successors and assigns, except that you may not assign or transfer
                                    this Agreement without Corbis’ prior written consent.

        &lt;p /&gt;
        Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use this Web Site unsupervised 
        and we ask that children do not register for an account or submit any personal 
        information to us. By using this Web Site unsupervised, and/or registering for

        &lt;b&gt;Personal Information&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis collects certain personal information from users of this Web Site. 
        To create user accounts, authorized users must provide certain contact 
        and account information such as name, email address, billing address,

        Corbis may use this information for the following purposes:

        &lt;li&gt;to contact you about a material change to this Privacy Policy or Site Usage Agreement,
        if necessary;
        &lt;li&gt;to comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
        in order to conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with
        legal process served on us; and
        &lt;li&gt;to third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process, including, but not
        limited to mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis may also share or disclose your personally identifiable information that is collected 
        on the Web Site to Corbis’ parent and affiliated companies who are offering products or 
        services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally identifiable 
        information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may 
        use such information to contact you with an advertisement or offering related to a product or services.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, Corbis does not sell, share or rent information 
        about its customers to third parties for their marketing or promotional purposes.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Lightbox Referral&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        If you use our referral service for informing a friend about our Web Site, or inviting a friend to view 
        your lightbox, we will ask you for the friend's name and email address. Corbis will automatically send 
        your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Web Site. Corbis does not retain this information.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Profile Information&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Your profile information (such as company type and language preference) in the registration form is used 
        by Corbis to create personalized content, services, and advertising on the Web Site. Corbis may 
        also profile your Web Site activity in order to accurately track your account and provide you with Corbis 
        products and services that correspond to your interests. Corbis may also compile data in aggregate form 
        so that we may better understand the users that are visiting our Web Site. For example, we may produce 
        reports on the most popular search terms by collecting general search term data based on individual searches. 
        Aggregate data is anonymous and does not contain any personal information that identifies a user. Corbis may 
        provide non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our Web Site users to 
        third parties for their audit, research and analytical purposes. 
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Automatically Collected Information&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        As is true of most web sites, when you access and use the Web Site, we gather certain information 
        automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) 
        addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, 
        date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 
        &lt;p /&gt;
        We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer 
        the Web Site, to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic information 
        about our user base as a whole.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        We do link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. IP 
        addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to segregate customer types 
        for analytical purposes. 
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Use of Service Providers&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        We occasionally hire or partner with other companies to provide limited services on our 
        behalf, such as managing and handling the processing and delivery of mailings (both email 
        and postal mail), providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing 
        statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal 
        information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality 
        of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

        &lt;a class="RegularLink" href="mailto:service@corbis.com"&gt;service@corbis.com&lt;/a&gt;,

        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Security&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis has a number of operational functions in place to protect the confidentiality of 
        personal information. For example, we store the personal information you provide on 
        computer systems with limited access that are located in secured facilities. Corbis' 
        employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. If you have any 
        questions about the security at our Web Site, you can send an email to 
        &lt;a class="RegularLink" href="mailto:service@corbis.com"&gt;service@corbis.com&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        We use SSL encryption technologies to transmit sensitive information such as a credit 
        card number to our servers. However, perfect security on the Internet does not exist, 
        and Corbis does not warrant that its Web Site is impenetrable or invulnerable to hackers.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Cookies&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        When you visit the Web Site, Corbis sends your computer a cookie, which is a small 
        file that resides on your computer's hard drive and contains non-personally identifiable 
        information about the user. Cookies only identify the user's computer. Cookies allow 
        Corbis to make its Web Site more useful by storing information about your preferences. 
        For example, Corbis will send your computer a cookie to maintain default settings such 
        as your language preference. You can set your browser's options not to accept cookies, 
        but this may prevent you from accessing all of the features of the Corbis Web Site.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis uses a third party to assist in managing the licensing of our images. This 
        third party uses clear GIFs, a tiny 1x1 pixel GIF, to digitally watermark our images, 
        in both a visible and invisible manner. When you purchase a licensed image from us, the 
        visible watermark is then removed from the image, however, in certain lower resolution images, 
        an invisible watermark may remain, allowing Corbis and the third party to track certain usage 
        of such images on the Internet.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Email&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Corbis does not rent, share or sell email 
        lists to third parties for their promotional purposes. Corbis may send you email to 
        notify you about your recent order; this will be sent to the email address you provide to Corbis.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis offers its members the choice to not receive emails or updates about special benefits, 
        promotions, or offers from Corbis. If you no longer wish to receive these updates, or you 
        wish to unsubscribe from your Corbis account please complete the Contact Us form on the Web 
        Site and let us know in the comments section that you would like to be removed from the mailing list.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them 
        by following the instructions included in each communication (e.g. following the unsubscribe 
        instructions within the email) or you may contact us at &lt;a href="mailto:service@corbis.com" class="RegularLink"&gt;service@corbis.com&lt;/a&gt;, 
        or telephone us at 1-800-260-0444, to opt-out.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Surveys, Promotions, and Contests&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Participation in surveys, promotions, or contests on the Web Site is completely voluntary and 
        the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personal information. Information 
        requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic 
        information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award promotional 
        gifts prizes. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use of the Web Site.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Discussion Threads&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis may offer discussion threads and comment boxes on the Web Site. If you use Corbis' discussion 
        threads or comment boxes, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information 
        you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be 
        used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable 
        information you choose to submit in these discussion threads.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Links&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Please be aware that the Web Site may contain links to other sites that are covered 
        by their own privacy policies. Corbis is not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
        other sites and we encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site. We recommend 
        that our users read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
        identifiable information.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Changes of Corbis' Online Privacy Policy&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        Corbis reserves the right to change our online privacy policy and modify this privacy 
        statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to make any material 
        changes to our privacy statement, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent 
        notice on our Web Site including the home page and other places we deem appropriate, at 
        least thirty (30) days prior to implementing the change so that you are aware of what 
        information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
        You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
        &lt;p /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p /&gt;
        We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief
        that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to
        comply with a legal process served on our Web Site.

account and Corbis has approved your registration, you may be able to access Content without a visible 
watermark. In applying for a Corbis account, you agree to furnish true and accurate information. Corbis 
reserves sole discretion over whether to grant you an account, and you agree to access the authorized

&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Limited License for Comp Usage&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
Conditioned on your compliance with this Agreement, Corbis grants you a limited license to download Content 
consisting of images solely for evaluating whether you wish to purchase a license to the image according to 
Corbis Content License Agreement applicable to your use (“Comps”).  If you are not a registered user, your 
Comp license covers only visibly watermarked Content, and does not entitle you to download Content which 
does not contain a visible watermark.  You may use Comps solely for your internal evaluation and for no 
longer than sixty (60) days from the date of download solely to determine whether you intend to obtain a 
non-Comp license for the Content. You may not use a Comp image in any final materials distributed within 
your company or any materials distributed outside of your company or to the public or in any online or other 
electronic distribution system.  Except for this limited, internal testing and sample use, Corbis grants 
you no other rights, and you may not copy, distribute, publish, display, sublicense, make available, or 
otherwise use in any way the comp outside the scope of this Agreement. To access images without a visible 
watermark, you must register for a Corbis account.
&lt;p /&gt;
Corbis may immediately terminate any licenses granted to you without notice if you fail to comply with 
any provision of this agreement or with the Corbis Content License Agreement applicable to your use. 
If a license is terminated, you agree to immediately (i) stop using this Site and the Content and (ii) 
delete all Content and all copies from all magnetic media and destroy all other copies, or, at Corbis’ 
request, return all such copies to Corbis.

of any use of User Content or of these Community Pages.
