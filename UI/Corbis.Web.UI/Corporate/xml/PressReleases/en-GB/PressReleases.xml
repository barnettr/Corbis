        <i>
          Interactive photographic display celebrates fall of the Berlin Wall
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>London (August 27 2008) - </b>Corbis, a leading visual media provider for the creative community, today announced that its photography will be displayed at the upcoming 'Create Berlin Goes London' exhibition. Corbis imagery will be used as part of a creative concept designed by two German agencies, Magma Brand Design and Xplicit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking place one year ahead of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the exhibition celebrates the explosion of creativity and openness that resulted from the Wall's collapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this event, the theme 'Berlin - creative metropolis' will be illustrated by 20 top design concepts. These concepts were selected by a jury from over 70 submissions from German agencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amongst these successful submissions is 'Off Limits' created by Magma Brand Design and Xplicit. The work is based on a 3.5 metre cube through which visitors can walk. The outside of the cube will feature black and white images, derived from the extensive Corbis archives including Corbis, Corbis Sygma and Corbis Reuters. These images depict borders, barbed wires, fences and refugees. On the inside of the cube, text will be projected onto the wall to reinforce the 'Off Limits' message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Siri Vorbeck, Creative Director of Photography at Corbis says: "The historical images were selected because they reinforce the feeling of repression and isolation. We wanted to remind visitors of the unspeakable sorrow experienced by those people living in Berlin after the Wall was constructed."
      </p>

      <p>
        The exhibition will kick off on 18th September with an introduction by Klaus Wowereit, the Mayor of Berlin. This three-day exhibition will be held at the Dray Walk Gallery at Truman Brewery, Brick Lane, East London.

          Acclaimed Celebrity Photographer Jason Joyce Creates Out-of-this-world Look
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LONDON (July 28, 2008) - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a leading visual media provider for the creative community, today announced the addition of futuristic sports imagery to its collection. The imagery by acclaimed photographer Jason Joyce is featured along with photography of iconic athletes, contemporary champions and action shots from a host of leading sporting events on Corbis' sports microsite <a href="http://pro.corbis.com/creative/sports/" target="_blank">www.corbis.com/sports</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new imagery from Joyce features women fencers, swimmers, archers, weight-lifters, soccer players and others in high concept futuristic settings. The images have been carefully retouched to give the photos a clean, vibrant and surreal look.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept and storyboard for the shoot in London was conceived and managed by Corbis Art Director Martin Yates. Joyce designed the set-up and lighting for the shoot so the images would be suitable for the post-production team to manipulate. The retouching was handled at Corbis, and a 3-D designer created the backgrounds using state-of-the-art 3-D imaging software.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Our creative research consistently finds that there is a lot of demand for imagery featuring women in sports, and this new collection celebrates female athletes in a way that is undoubtedly compelling and unique," said Martin Yates, Art Director, Corbis. "The atmosphere for the shoot was inspired by science fiction movies like Aeon Flux and transports us to another time and place."
      </p>

      <p>
        Jason Joyce lives and works in London. He began his career as a fashion photographer before moving into celebrity portraiture. His work has been published in world-leading publications including <i>Interview</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Harpers Bazaar</i> and <i>Q</i>. Recently he has shot advertising campaigns for Mother and McCann Erickson advertising agencies in the UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        "With the summer games in Beijing approaching, we wanted to create something fresh and different that appeals to creatives looking for an alternative vision," said Joyce. "I'm really proud of this work and the way it breaks down preconceived notions of beauty and athletics."

          Clearance Experts Help Pack Celebrity Punch in Ads around the World
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>CANNES, FRANCE (June 19, 2008) - </b>GreenLight, a Corbis company and one of the world's leading Intellectual Property services firms, today announced its rights and music clearances work for advertising campaigns for leading brands such as Old Spice, Ballantine's and American Family Insurance. GreenLight has recently worked with leading advertisings agencies in North America, Europe and Asia including Weiden + Kennedy, Publicis, Element 79, and Y&amp;R. The announcement was made at Cannes Lions 2008, the 55th International Advertising Festival, held June 15-21 in Cannes, France.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weiden + Kennedy of Portland, Oregon turned to GreenLight to help clear a photograph of actress Kim Novak to be used in a print ad for Old Spice deodorant. After W+K's creatives stumbled across the photo in a book of historical celebrity images, GreenLight was able to locate and secure the appropriate copyright so that the advertisement could feature the image of the famous actress along with the memorable tag-line "Blondes Prefer Gentlemen." The ad was initially intended to run just once, but it drew such a positive response that Old Spice extended the campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We knew that the image we discovered would be perfect for our campaign, and GreenLight really came through in quickly handling the clearances for us," said Heather Smith Harvey, Art Buyer, Weiden + Kennedy. "Their involvement helped us create a really fun ad that connected with consumers."
      </p>

      <p>
        GreenLight also worked on behalf of Publicis UK to clear the use of images of John McEnroe, Steve McQueen and other iconic personalities to appear in Ballantine's Whisky advertisements in Spain and Portugal.
      </p>

      <p>
        "GreenLight was a true partner in helping us negotiate rights and clearances for a high-profile Ballantine's whisky campaign," said Stacy Koetsier, Client Director, Publicis. "Their insight into negotiation strategy with well-known celebrities was instrumental in securing the deals and helping us deliver a top-notch advertising campaign."
      </p>

      <p>
        In creating an integrated print, radio, TV, and online campaign for American Family Insurance, ad agency Element 79, based in Chicago, wanted to include iconic American pop culture references. One big challenge was that they were on a tight timeline and it was the 2007 holiday season. Element 79 turned to GreenLight to clear the use of clips from the popular TV shows Green Acres, The Munsters, and The Brady Bunch. With its unrivaled Rolodex of Hollywood contacts, GreenLight cleared the required rights in just three days, allowing Element 79 to present a winning ad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Y&amp;R Jakarta, Indonesia enlisted GreenLight's help in clearing the publishing rights for the song "Que Sera, Sera" for use in a television commercial for Indonesian cement company Holcim. The well-known song, which was a hit for Doris Day in 1956, was given new lyrics and sung in Indonesian. This unlikely pairing of this subject and song proved to be popular across Indonesia and generated good buzz on the Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        "GreenLight's vast experience and connections with these types of clearances made the process a successful one," said Aryanto Nugroho, Group Account Director, Y&amp;R.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We free up creatives to spend more time and energy on developing great concepts," said Mark Sherman, Senior Vice President and Head of GreenLight. "Our mission is to provide airtight clearances quickly and cost-effectively to help great advertising ideas fly."

          Acclaimed Films, Outtakes and Never-Before-Seen Footage to Be Re-mastered in High Definition (HD) and Offered through Corbis Motion
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK (May 30, 2008)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a leading visual media provider for the creative community, today announced that it will begin offering clips from films, outtakes and previously unreleased footage in HD from Maysles Films Corbis (<a href="http://www.mayslesfilms.com/" target="_blank">www.mayslesfilms.com</a>), one of America's most recognized documentary filmmakers. The announcement was made last night during an exclusive screening and book signing of A Maysles Scrapbook: Photographs/Cinemagraphs/Documents with Albert Maysles at Tribeca Cinemas in New York City.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recognized for making some of the world's best known documentaries and character studies including <i>Gimme Shelter, Meet Marlon Brando, With Love from Truman, Salesman, and Grey Gardens</i> the Maysles brothers have captivated audiences around the world for more than 50 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Corbis is re-mastering many of the films as well as unexpected outtakes and personal footage into high quality HD video that may be licensed quickly and easily through Corbis Motion (<a href="http://www.corbismotion.com/" target="_blank">www.corbismotion.com</a>) or a Corbis customer service representative. Many of the outtakes were experiments taken during the filming and reveal new insight into the riveting documentaries.  Corbis Motion will make several hundred clips from films and footage available for preview on its website over the coming months.
      </p>

      <p>
        "As a documentarian, my efforts are directed at fostering public discourse and encouraging better understanding of humanity," said Albert Maysles. "I have spent a lifetime uncovering the power of the truth and romance of discovery, and through this collaboration with Corbis we can happily spread the reach of these works."
      </p>

      <p>
        Two of America's foremost non-fiction filmmakers, Albert Maysles and his brother David Maysles (1932-1987) are recognized as pioneers of "direct cinema," the American version of French "cinema veritÃ©." They earned their distinguished reputations by being the first to make non-fiction feature films that capture the complexity of human life without scripts, sets or narration.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The Maysles are simply among the most talented American documentarians and have given the world an unforgettable cultural legacy," said Skip d'Amico, Director of Motion, Corbis. "The addition of this work speaks to the quality, sophistication and uniqueness of the Corbis Motion collection."
      </p>

      <p>
        Clips from the films will be available for both editorial and commercial use.  All uses will require appropriate rights clearances, which can be handled by Corbis Rights Services. Among the films to be re-mastered over the next 24 months are <i>Meet Marlon Brando, With Love from Truman, Salvador Dali's Fantastic Dream, Psychiatry in Russia, Showman, McGovern, Russian Close Up, Orson Welles in Spain, Salesman, Umbrellas and Grey Gardens.</i>

        Maysles Films has been the leading force in non-fiction film since the 1960's.

Their films, Salesman (1968), Gimme Shelter (1970) and Grey Gardens (1976) stand as acknowledged landmarks in the realm of documentary feature films. Maysles Films, Inc. has conceived and produced more than three dozen films, commissioned and non-commissioned. Their inspiration is forever derived from the drama and truth of the human experience.

        <b>NEW YORK (May 2, 2008)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a leading visual media provider for the creative community, and the Art Directors Club (ADC), today announced the professional and student winners of the 2nd annual Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award &amp; Scholarship, part of the 87th Annual ADC Awards program recognizing the best in advertising and design from around the world. The winners were revealed at the annual ADC Awards Gala held last night at the ADC Gallery in New York City.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award &amp; Scholarship honors the best work created by professionals and students on behalf of non-profits on a pro bono basis. Agency creatives receive the prestigious ADC Cubes, and Corbis donates $20,000 to the non-profit cause and awards the student winner with a $5,000 scholarship. This year, Corbis is inviting the creative community to join the "Search for Justice" and increase Corbis' donation to the social justice causes just by searching for images at <a href="http://www.corbis.com/searchforjustice" target="_blank">www.corbis.com/searchforjustice</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>2008 Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award Winners Strike Gold!</b><br/>
        The professional award this year was a tie, with both winners receiving the ADC's highest honor, the prestigious ADC Gold Cube. The benefiting charitable causes will split the $20,000 prize as well as additional money resulting from Corbis' "Search for Justice" initiative.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We are so thrilled that these winners received the ADC's highest honor "" the ADC Gold Cube," said Renee Martin, Vice President, Sales &amp; Service, North America, who presented the awards to the winners at the ADC Gala. "Corbis is dedicated to supporting the creative community and the non-profit causes that creatives have spent their hard-to-find free time to support. We love recognizing this incredible talent."
      </p>

      <p>
        TAXI Canada was awarded a Gold Cube for a community initiative it conceived and launched called The 15 Below Project(<a href="http://15belowproject.org" target="_blank">http://15belowproject.org</a>) to mark the agency's 15-year anniversary.  TAXI executive creative director, Steve Mykolyn, developed the idea for the high-concept, low-cost jackets to help the homeless who can't get off the streets to survive extreme winter conditions. Stuffed with newspaper it's a winter coat. Stuffing removed, it becomes a raincoat. When not being worn, it converts into a backpack that can be used as a pillow. On behalf of its clients and staff, TAXI Canada donated 3,000 15 Below jackets to the homeless throughout Canada and the U.S.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vitruvio Leo Burnett Spain was awarded a Gold Cube for its pro bono work supporting the Prodis Foundation(<a href="http://www.fundacionprodis.org" target="_blank">www.fundacionprodis.org</a>), which helps those with Down syndrome achieve a more independent lifestyle.  Vitruvio Leo Burnett responded to a brief from Prodis to create a public awareness campaign communicating that children with Down syndrome can be active participants in society. The agency conceived a campaign called "Let Us Do It," whereby children with Down's created and shot an ad and movie trailer themselves to address misconceptions about those with Down syndrome and illustrate their capabilities and skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        James Wang, a student of New York-based School of Visual Arts (SVA), was selected as the Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Scholarship winner for his project based on the Darfur Genocide Campaign (<a href="http://www.savedarfur.org" target="_blank">www.savedarfur.org</a>), an organization dedicated to raising public awareness about the atrocities in Darfur. James' poster campaign expressed the loss of life in Darfur through graphic symbolism and a slogan "˜400,000 killed and still growing.' The artwork consisted of a long succession of posters featuring red check marks, which visually expressed the number of lives lost. The red check marks also became the campaign's logo. While the project was done on behalf of a real non-profit organization, it did not require the participation or consent of the organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It's clear that this award category is driven by passion""from the non-profits to the creatives and full circle back to Corbis," said Ami Brophy, Executive Director of the ADC. "We hope that these awards encourage others to use their creative skills to benefit the non-profit sector and ultimately their communities at large."
      </p>

      <p>

    <EventDesc>Corbis Names New Leadership for Its Prestigious Outline Brand</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Industry Veteran Edie Tobias Rejoins Corbis</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LOS ANGELES  (January 9, 2008)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced that Edie Tobias will rejoin the company to lead its world-renowned celebrity offering, including the Outline, Outline@Home, OutlineLive and Entertainment red-carpet collections.  Tobias is taking over from Beate Chelette, Senior Director of Photography, who successfully led the division for nearly two years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tobias has more than 20 years of experience and is widely respected as an industry expert and advocate for photographers.  This is her second time with the company, having worked at Corbis as a Director of Photography from 2000 to 2005, following its acquisition of Sharpshooters where she was president.  For the past nearly three years, Tobias served as Vice President of Creative Content at Jupiterimages, responsible for the visual direction of its top tier brands. Tobias will continue to be based in Los Angeles.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Edie is widely recognized for her leadership, her ability to embrace great photography and her strong industry relationships," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. "It's great to welcome her back to Corbis to oversee the continued growth of our acclaimed Outline brand."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I am really pleased to return to Corbis," said Tobias. "It is an incredible opportunity to lead Outline and build on the momentum that Corbis has achieved in the celebrity arena over the past couple of years."
      </p>

      <p>
        Tobias is replacing Chelette, who joined Corbis when it acquired her company, Beateworks, in March 2006. Chelette has been instrumental in strengthening Corbis' position, including successfully introducing the breakthrough OutlineLive offering, recruiting acclaimed new photography talent and maintaining strong revenue performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This has been a rewarding past two years, and I am really proud of what we've accomplished as a team," said Chelette.  "Edie is the perfect choice to execute Corbis' long term strategies and will add her signature to the brands. Corbis' quality approach is what customers want, and I know it will be successful."

    <EventDesc>Corbis Enhances Sales and Service to Drive Growth</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Company Announces Plans to Introduce Regional Service Centers and Deploy In-The-Field Teams to Get Closer to Customers</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE (November 14, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced plans to bolster sales capabilities and enhance customer service around the world to drive growth in its image licensing businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Corbis is already recognized for our world-class customer service, and these improvements build on that heritage," said Gary Shenk, CEO, Corbis. "Transforming our sales organisation and customer service operations are critical to making us a more competitive player in the market."
      </p>

      <p>
        The company plans to streamline customer service by introducing convenient, highly responsive regional contact centers in Europe and North America. The new multi-lingual contact centers will enable the company to better serve all markets where it has operations today while phasing out bricks-and-mortar locations in select smaller markets during the first half of 2008.
      </p>

      <p>
        MedicalRF, based in Dublin, Ireland, specializes in digitally creating images that traditional photography cannot produce. The company uses cutting-edge technology to develop realistic and stylized three dimensional (3D) images that are designed particularly for medical anatomy and concepts.  The imagery is so realistic that it is difficult to discern if it is computer-generated or actual photography.
      </p>

      <p>
        To intensify its focus on the commercial and editorial imagery markets, the company will also deploy highly-connected in-the-field business development teams in most major advertising and media centers in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, expanding its current market-reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        To align its resources with its modernised structure, the company plans to streamline its sales organisation and related support functions, resulting in an overall global workforce reduction of approximately 125 positions.  The planned reductions are across most levels of the organisation and all geographies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The planned changes follow a comprehensive review of the company's business over the past six months and represent an important step towards profitability.  All changes are unrelated to current business performance or to its recent acquisition of Veer, which is not impacted.

        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced the addition of an extensive collection of specialized royalty-free (RF) medical imagery through a new partnership with MedicalRF, the world's largest provider of high quality medical RF
      </p>

      <p>
        Effective today, Corbis is offering thousands of powerful and distinct medical and life sciences digital illustrations via its website that cover a range of subjects including microscopic organisms, human anatomy, disease states and medical devices. This is the first time that this extensive and unusual type of imagery is available to be licensed royalty-free through a major global imagery provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Images are often the best way to engage people on health issues and to educate them about preventative care and treatment options," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. "This new collection features digitally produced illustrations that are visually compelling and that make finding appropriate images to illustrate the majority of medical anatomy and concepts a lot easier than ever before."

      <p>
        Images from the collection are typically licensed for a variety of advertising, educational and other uses by professionals in life sciences, medical, pharmaceutical, biotech advertising and communications industries as well as the editorial and publishing sectors.  The healthcare industry remains one of the fastest growing advertising markets, with spending in the pharmaceutical sector up more than 7 percent in the first half of 2007 according to Nielsen.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This collection specializes in different types of medical images that appeal to different types of customers and meet their individual needs," said Niall Johnston, Vice President of Business Development, MedicalRF. "Some images are more scientific in nature and detail, while some are more conceptual.  The collection generally has medical content to meet the requirements of all market sectors including advertising, marketing, publishing and editorial."

    <EventDesc>Corbis Celebrates Preservation of Renowned Sygma Collection with a One Night VIP Exhibition in London</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Event Recognises Sygma's Move to a New World-Class Facility, Ensuring it Remains Safe and Accessible for Future Generations</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LONDON (October 17, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, last night celebrated its Sygma Preservation Initiative with a special event in London. Begun in 2004, the project will ensure the collections' 50 million objects including slides, negatives, prints and contact sheets are carefully protected in new long-term home at an advanced, climate controlled preservation facility near Paris, while being brought to life and made more widely accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The event, held at The Galleria in Pall Mall, included a selection of some of the most iconic images from the archive including intimate portraits of Alfred Hitchcock, Bob Dylan and Nelson Mandela, harrowing images of war in Chechnya, the Gulf and Rwanda and daring reportage of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre. Two well known Sygma photographers, Richard Smith, winner of the BBC Young Photographer of the Year, and Orde Eliasson, founder of Link Photography, were in attendance for the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Corbis is committed to investing in the preservation of the profoundly important Sygma archive, one of the greatest collections of photojournalism in the world and an invaluable historical record of many momentous events from the past half century," said Stefan Biberfeld, Senior Corporate Council, EMEA, who is overseeing the Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative. "We were proud to recognise the preservation and access work that is being undertaken with a special one night exhibition in London."
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of its work with Sygma, Corbis is collaborating with Locarchives, a proven specialist in archiving and document management, who will build the new "living" archive dedicated specifically to the Sygma collection.  It will be located in Garnay, approximately 45 minutes outside Paris, making it easily accessible for photographers, researchers, historians, iconographers and others professionals interested in consulting the archives in person.  The eight hundred square meter facility will have approximately seven thousand meters of shelving in a climate controlled, airtight environment with advanced fire safety and security protections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 2005, a dedicated team of Corbis editors and archivists has been undertaking the initial phases of the "Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative" leading up to the move of the collection.  This has involved changing the archive classification system to classify pictures by photographer rather than by theme to regularize royalties, promote the collection and make it accessible to the public via the digitalization of prints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, since the imagery within the Sygma collection is the property of each photographer, Corbis has been contacting the more than 10,000 contributors to offer them an archive agreement confirming that they wish to participate in the archiving and commercial development of their works.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, Corbis is collaborating closely with the photographers to bring the collection to life by searching, identifying and digitizing the most significant photos from the collection to be available via the Corbis website.  Since 2002, Corbis has digitized more than 55,000 pictures to bring the total number available online to 800,000 from the collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Sygma archive is comprised of nine separate collections of unique photos from the second half of the 20th century.  The 1950s and 1960s imagery includes photography from Apis, Universal Photo, Interpress, Spitzer, Reporter Associés and other agencies.  The collections from the 1970s and beyond includes the prestigious photojournalism, news, magazines, celebrities and portraits from the Sygma photo agency, as well as television and movie set imagery from Kipa, and sporting events from Tempsport.

The winning entry, "Fastest Bike Courier," created by photographer Hans Starck and submitted by Scholz &amp; Friends Berlin, was chosen from more than 250 submissions from across Europe.

      </p>

      <p>
        Stark received a €5,000 prize and a pass to this year's Golden Drum Festival for his winning entry.

        "The overall quality of the entries was really impressive as was the sheer number of submissions," said Siri Vorbeck, Creative Director, EMEA, for Corbis. "Having so many excellent photographs to choose from made the selection process very difficult."
      </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      •	<b>Global Greening</b>: The grassroots movement among environmentalists has blossomed into a worldwide mainstream interest in eco-friendly living. Global Greening is playing out in a host of specific concepts demanding relevant imagery including Karma Consumers, Green Glamour, Children of Nature, Eco Travelers, World Protectors and Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS), all demonstrating how green is in vogue and increasingly a matter of personal responsibility.<br/>
    •	<b>Generational Re-Connect</b>: As a result of demographic and social trends, the number of multigenerational families sharing the same household in the United States has grown by approximately 60 percent over the past 15 years, mirroring trends in Europe and Asia, where family has always played an important cultural role. Images of kids, parents and grandparents spending time together and sharing the same household are becoming increasingly relevant.<br/>
    •	<b>Millennial Development</b>: Around the world in emerging and developed countries, today's kids, known as "Millennials," are going to school in ever greater numbers. U.S. enrollment is up 10% since 1970, partly driven by immigration, and the UN has put a focus on achieving universal primary schooling by 2015 as part of its Millennium Development goals. Meanwhile, technology is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in today's school. As a result, imagery of modern, diverse and multi-cultural school environments is increasingly in demand.<br/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        "The Creative Boutique is the fastest and easiest way to explore highly conceptual, beautifully produced creative photography at Corbis, and we think it demonstrates our commitment to premium imagery," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis.

    <EventDesc>Corbis and European Pressphoto Agency (epa) Extend Distribution Partnership to France</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>
          After Strong Sales through Corbis in Other Markets since 2005 Agreement, epa to Begin Distribution via Corbis in France
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>PERPIGNAN, France  (September 3, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced an exclusive agreement with the European Pressphoto Agency (epa) to extend its extensive marketing, distribution and licensing partnership to France.  The announcement was made at the VISA POUR L'IMAGE 19th Annual International Festival of Photojournalism taking place September 1 to September 16, 2007 in Perpignan, France.
      </p>

      <p>
        The announcement builds upon the success of Corbis licensing epa imagery in many other markets throughout Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, an agreement that was first signed and announced in 2005.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the agreement, Corbis will market in France epa's news-based photography to all magazine and book publishers, as well as advertising and marketing creative professionals. The editorial teams from both companies cooperate daily to ensure that the most relevant and vivid images are delivered for a diverse range of global audiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Philippe Bagot, Corbis Vice President of Sales for Europe, commented: "The French media industry is heavily demanding current events and news archive imagery. With one of the highest magazine readership in Europe, a particularly large selection of national news magazines and the increasing popularity of media websites, France is a critical market place for high-quality international news photography.  epa fulfils that need by covering news, entertainment and sports all over the world and will find an ideal distribution partner through Corbis' sales and web site in France."
      </p>

      <p>
        Since its initial partnership agreement with Corbis in 2005, epa has continued to expand in the global news photography market. Its outstanding imagery is regularly featured in front page coverage around the world. epa's worldwide network of 400 photographers continue to contribute to an average daily epa photo report of over 800 images.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sandra Boerma, Director International Sales at epa, added: "We originally chose to work with Corbis in many global markets because we felt Corbis' offering complemented our own. In the last two years we have been pleased with how the partnership has extended our brand around the world. The addition of this service in France, an important geographical market for us, is an important next step."

        <i>Company Puts Focus on Creating a Virtual Community Space for Art Enthusiasts While Showcasing Corbis and SnapVillage Collections as well as Rights Services Expertise</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE  (August 29, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced that it has opened a gallery in Second Life that is focused on creating a community space where those interested in art and photography can view, share and discuss imagery.  
      </p>

        <p>
       Corbis' presence in Second Life will showcase imagery from the Corbis and SnapVillage microstock collections as well as provide information on Corbis' world-leading Rights Services expertise.  Corbis is also planning to help create a greater sense of community amongst photography enthusiasts in Second Life by hosting in-world social events, art shows and competitions where people can share their imagery with other residents. Image licensing will not be available at this time via Second Life.
      </p>    

      <p>
       Stephen Gillett, Corbis' Vice President of Technology (Avatar Name: Corbis Kamachi), led the design and creation efforts for the Corbis gallery in Second Life. Gillett is a well-known and highly respected online MMORPG gamer and guild master. The gallery is located on an island in a sweeping glassed-in gallery space that has specific areas highlighting imagery from different Corbis collections, as well as Corbis Motion, Corbis Rights Services and SnapVillage, an innovative new user-generated microstock web site.
      </p>    
 
      <p>
      "We didn't want this to be some big-bang corporate marketing activity, but instead are taking a grassroots approach by focusing on sharing great imagery for the SL community to enjoy," said Gillett. "We hope to make our gallery a social gathering place and a cultural landmark within Second Life and foster a lot of discussion about photography in this emerging medium." 
      </p>    

       <p>
      Gallery visitors will be able to browse iconic images from Corbis' collection sourced from more than 100 million creative, entertainment and historical images, and the galleries will be updated regularly with fresh pieces.

        <i>Bounty, GE and BC Hydro Turn to Corbis for VIP Access to Film Clips, Famous Figures and Hard-to-find Footage to bring their TV Ad Campaigns to Life </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK  (August 15, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced its work with major brands including Bounty, GE and BC Hydro to help them quickly and easily find, license and handle personality clearances for footage and film clips that were integral to television commercials in North America and Europe.  The TV campaigns were created by leading advertising agencies including Publicis, BBDO New York and DDB Canada with help from Corbis Rights &amp; Music Clearances.
      </p>

        <p>
       Publicis called on Corbis to help produce a Bounty TV commercial currently airing in the UK and Ireland. The commercial features two recurring Bounty characters that were edited into a scene of the 1970 hit British romantic comedy "Carry on Loving."  In the commercial, characters use Bounty paper towels to clean up the mess created by the food fight at the wedding.  Corbis licensed clips from the film and handled personality clearances for actors Sid James, Hattie Jacques and Kenneth Williams through their respective estates. 
      </p>    
      
      <p>
       "We were very impressed with the service that Corbis provided us," said Clare Young, Producer, Publicis. "The whole process ran very smoothly, and we would not hesitate in using Corbis again for any future projects."
      </p>    
      
      <p>
      BBDO New York recently enlisted Corbis to help source HD footage of animals of the Serengeti for an in-cinema and online campaign for GE called "Serengeti."  The spot highlights GE's ecomagination campaign and features a casting call for the movie "Evan Almighty," using real animals like a baboon and an elephant taking direction from the movie crew.
      </p>    
      
       <p>
      "Our team had a great idea for our client, but we needed footage of Serengeti animals to bring this idea to life quickly," said Regina Ebel, Head of Broadcast Production, BBDO New York. "We chose to work with Corbis because we know they have great relationships and resources, and they were able to research and supply the footage mastered to HD."
      </p>    
      
      <p>
      DDB Canada turned to Corbis for help on a TV and online campaign for BC Hydro, one of the largest electric utilities in Canada. The idea for the spot, called the "Power of One," was to feature how famous Canadians including astronaut Marc Garneau, Academy-Award nominated actor Chief Dan George, paraplegic athlete and activist Rick Hansen and NHL Hockey Coach Roger Neilson started something small and ended up doing something big. The commercial illustrates that with individual small energy saving steps, BC Hydro customers can achieve big combined savings in electricity use. Corbis researched and negotiated the appropriate famous personalities and obtained rights clearances while simultaneously sourcing footage. 
      </p>    
      
       <p>
      "Corbis helped elevate our ad to a whole new level by helping to find and secure just the right people to communicate our message," said Lynn Bonham, Broadcast Producer, DDB Canada. "Since they handle more than 5,000 clearances a year, we knew they'd be the right partner as BC Hydro tries to start a social movement towards energy efficiency."
      </p>    
      
      <p>
      "We want to help take the pressure off so Creatives can focus on great ideas and brilliant results," said Curtis Bowden, Vice President, Rights Services, Corbis. "With our deep relationships in Hollywood and with content owners around the world, we know how much licensing rights should cost and can advise clients on what is most likely to clear within the desired timeframe and budget so they can be confident that their great ideas will come to life."
      </p>    
      
      <p>
     Corbis has the world's leading Rights &amp; Music Clearances offering with experienced, dedicated global teams of specialists handling licensing of content and related personality clearances.  Corbis has unprecedented relationships with third-party rights holders—including major studios, record companies, celebrities, estates and publishers—enabling it to help clients license almost any content and handle all clearances for use.

</p>
      
      
      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE  (June 25, 2007)  - </b>SnapVillage, empowered by Corbis, today announced the beta opening of a fresh, interactive and innovative online marketplace for user-generated photography at <a href="http://www.snapvillage.com" target="_blank">www.snapvillage.com</a>. The new website has no membership fees and is now accepting submissions from photographers anywhere in the world and offering image licensing in the United States.</p>

      <p>Built from the ground-up after an extensive review and analysis of existing microstock sites and the rapidly evolving Web 2.0 and user-generated environments, the beta opening of SnapVillage introduces innovative advances in the submission, pricing, searching and purchasing of royalty-free (RF) photography that can be bought once and used almost anywhere for any duration. </p>

	 <p>"SnapVillage is a major step forward for microstock with fresh, thoughtfully designed innovations that simplify and improve the experience of licensing low-cost, user-generated, royalty-free photography via the Internet," said Gary Shenk, incoming Chief Executive Officer, Corbis. "We're excited about also using SnapVillage as a farm club to find great photographers who can sell their photographs on Corbis." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Aside from providing contact and PayPal information, the website does not require any application or approval processes for photographers or any pre-pay obligations of buyers. While in beta, SnapVillage will be actively listening and incorporating customer feedback and introducing enhancements to the website on a continuous basis over the coming months.</p>

<p>
<b>Picture Perfect Advancements Help Photographers Maximize Their Income</b><br/>
SnapVillage introduces a revolutionary pricing model that gives pricing flexibility and control to photographers across a broader range of prices than other microstock websites, as well as streamlined submission and the opportunity for their photography to be upgraded to Corbis.<br/>
•	<b>Pricing That Empowers Photographers:</b> SnapVillage's unique pricing structure gives photographers greater control and flexibility in managing and maximizing their photography and income. The SnapVillage ‘Pick Your Own Price' model gives photographers the ability to set image price levels at five increments of $1, $5, $10, $25 and $50. Photographers are able to change prices on their pictures at any time. SnapVillage does not have any type of exclusivity agreements and pays a royalty rate of 30 percent across the board for all flat price image sales, and 30 cents a download on all subscriptions sales. All photographer payments are made via PayPal. <br/>
•	<b>Access to the Premium Market:</b>As part of the Corbis network, SnapVillage can offer its contributors something most other microstock sites can't: potential access to the premium stock photography market. SnapVillage will act as a ‘farm club' as Corbis editors will be scouting SnapVillage to find great photographers who show the potential to sell their work on Corbis. <br/>
•	<b>Streamlined Image Submission:</b> SnapVillage's open submission process invites anyone worldwide, from the hobbyist to the professional photographer, to submit images to SnapVillage's website. Images will be processed by the SnapVillage editorial team who will review the imagery before releasing them to the SnapVillage website. Images may be uploaded directly through the Internet or by mailing a DVD to SnapVillage (address available at SnapVillage.com).
 </p>

      <p>
<b>SnapVillage Defines Simplicity for Creative People Looking for Affordable, Flexible Photography</b><br/>
SnapVillage is designed to be simple enough for anyone to use, from the seasoned design professional to the novice school newsletter editor. SnapVillage has an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, simple pricing and payment and rich user-interactivity that leverages the community to identify the freshest imagery. <br/>
•	<b>Straightforward Pricing and Payment:</b>   SnapVillage makes purchasing images simple and easy. Photographs can either be licensed individually or via a subscription. Individual images are available at $1, $5, $10, $25 and $50, and there is the same flat price for all file sizes {Small (~3mb), Medium (~6-8mb) and Large (more than 10mb)}. In addition, SnapVillage offers a subscription at a cost of $199 for 30 days with a maximum of 750 downloads. All payments are conducted via credit card without cumbersome credit packs, tokens or other complicated pricing schemes that require buyers to make upfront commitments. A small selection of free content will always be available on SnapVillage to allow users to experiment with the website.<br/>
•	<b>Simple, Superior Customer Experience: </b> SnapVillage has a simple, clean, professional website that is designed to be more interesting and easier to use. SnapVillage has put an emphasis on making the website intuitive for all types of creative buyers, so that people with all levels of experience will feel comfortable using it. <br/>
•	<b>Snappyness Score Uncovers Fun, Fresh Imagery: </b> SnapVillage offers fun and useful interactivity features such as community image tagging, saving pictures as favorites, commenting on images and sharing images with others that allow users to communicate with each other and with the website in multiple ways, thereby enhancing the experience of the entire community. Every image in the SnapVillage catalog has a living, breathing "Snappyness" score based on a sophisticated and proprietary algorithm. "Snappyness" is a dynamic rating that is driven by multiple measures of a picture's popularity, including the number of times it has been viewed, downloaded, favorited, commented upon, shared and purchased. The Snappyness rating ensures that SnapVillage searches yield the freshest, best images.
 </p>
      
      <p>
      "With SnapVillage, we are trying to break out of the mold of the existing microstock websites," said Adam Brotman, Vice President, Networks, Corbis, who has overseen the creation of SnapVillage.

    <EventDesc>Corbis Shares Latest Visual and Cultural Trends Behind Creative Imagery </EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Gender Roles Are Being Redefined Globally, While North America Is Focused on Family, Europe on Getting Out of the Office for Work or Play, and Asia on the 2008 Olympics</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>Cannes, France (June 20, 2007)  - </b>Corbis today announced the latest emerging visual and cultural trends in imagery identified by its global Creative Intelligence team. The research and analysis is released on a quarterly basis to help anticipate the emerging imagery needs of creatives and guide photographers toward capturing images that are likely to be in high demand by advertising and marketing professionals around the world. The announcement was made during the Cannes International Advertising Festival taking place June 17 to June 23 in Cannes, France. </p>

      <p>The Corbis Creative Intelligence team supports both photographers and customers in their creative endeavors by anticipating future market shifts. The team works with local art directors to develop imagery that best reflects today's cultural and stylistic trends and that resonates strongly with target markets both regionally and globally. </p>

      <p>"Photographers love receiving trend information that will help set their work apart, while creatives find relevant imagery that supports their vision," said Amber Calo, Senior Manager, Creative Intelligence at Corbis. "By analyzing consumer trends and insights, we're walking in the same shoes as account planners at ad agencies. We ask the same questions and strive to deliver imagery that will resonate with their target markets."</p>
      
      <p>All of the following trends are relevant globally, but some are currently more pronounced in specific regions, and so are listed geographically.</p>
      
      <p>
      <b>Global Trends: Changing Gender Roles and Medical Tourism</b><br/>      
      •	<b>Rise of Female Entrepreneurs:</b> Women around the world are entering the workforce in record numbers, with many starting their own home-based businesses. As a result, men are taking a more active role in childrearing and domestic duties. Images of stay-at-home dads, mothers in business settings, and women multitasking at home represent this trend.<br/>      
      •	<b>Medical Miles:</b> Due to rising medical costs and overburdened healthcare systems, particularly in the US, UK, and Canada, many people are traveling overseas, especially to India, for high quality, less expensive medical procedures. Due to lower costs, some even use the opportunity to do some sight-seeing while they recuperate. Images that support this trend feature doctors and patients interacting, hi-tech medical facilities, and mature tourists around the world. <br/>   
      </p>
      
      
            <p>
     <b>North American Trends: Stronger Family Ties and Booming Schools</b><br/>      
     •	<b>Generational Re-Connect:</b> The number of multigenerational families living together in the US has grown by 60 percent over the past 15 years. As more Baby Boomers reach retirement age, many are taking a more active role in their grandchildren's lives. This trend is supported by images of grandparents providing child care, family vacations, and group photos with three or more generations represented. <br/>      
     •	<b>Millennial Development:</b> Driven by increased births during the late 1980s and a rise in immigration, a record-high 55 million children are projected to be enrolled in American schools by the fall of 2007. Minorities now make up 40 percent of elementary and high school students, compared with 21 percent in 1970. Imagery showcasing this trend includes diversity in schools, students interacting with teachers, and students using technology. <br/>      
      </p>
      
                  <p>
    <b>European Trends: The Flexible Office and City Tourism</b><br/>      
   •	<b>Out of Office:</b> The very definition of "office" has changed. Considerably more people are using non-traditional spaces such as cafes, bookstores, parks, and their homes to conduct their business, allowing greater flexibility and the opportunity to spend more time with family. Images of casual business meetings, working parents, and people working in coffee shops support this trend.<br/>        
   •	<b>Pocket Vacations:</b> City tourism has grown significantly in recent years, with people taking shorter trips closer to home rather than more traditional longer vacations to far-flung locales. Many of these vacations are to big cities across Europe and focus on sight-seeing and visits to famous cultural attractions. Images of families at tourist attractions, sight-seeing, and taking local transportation illustrate this trend.<br/>      
      </p>
      
                        <p>
    <b>Asia-Pacific Trends: Olympic Games and the Mainstream Goes Mobile</b><br/>      
   •	<b>Global Arena:</b> The 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing are expected to draw one million visitors from other parts of China and another half-million foreign tourists. To prepare for the Games and the influx of tourists, China is spending $30 billion to build stadiums and hotels and improve infrastructure such as transportation and telecommunications. Relevant images include shots of Olympic Sports and Olympic traditions, and Chinese landmarks and updated tourist attractions. <br/>      
   •	<b>Wi-Community: </b>Wireless technology, particularly mobile devices, is swiftly changing both work and social life across Asia. One of the fastest growing contributors to this industry is the mobile market, with China representing the world's largest market with over 431 million mobile users. This trend is reinforced by images of people of all ages using technology, businesspeople using wireless technology, and people traveling with technology.<br/>

    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Customer Base Soars by More than 50% as Companies and Ad Agencies Including American Greetings, Malibu-Kahlua International, ASPCA and AvreaFoster Turn to Corbis to Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness of Advertising and Marketing Operations </i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>NEW YORK (June 6, 2007)  - </b>Corbis today announced that the number of organizations using its industry-leading hosted Media Management solution has increased by more than 50 percent since the start of 2006.  Corbis has added more than 25 new customers including American Greetings, Malibu-Kahlua International and AvreaFoster as well as small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) including The St. Joe Company, Intergraph, The California State Automobile Association (CSAA) and The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). The announcement was made at the Henry Stewart DAM symposium in New York, NY.</p>

      <p>The strong customer growth and continued satisfaction for deployments of Corbis Media Management reinforces the solution's selection as the Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Digital Media Application in 2006.  Corbis Media Management helps streamline marketing operations to lower costs, shorten production times and enhance impact by centralizing, organizing and managing digital media assets.</p>

      <p>"Corbis Media Management is ideal for helping us better manage the various brand marketing campaigns we do," said Sandrine Ricard, Vice President, Communications, Malibu-Kahlua International. "We're able to locate and use content right away, get work out the door faster and make sure our brand is represented consistently on a global basis. It lets us focus on the creativity of our campaigns, without spending time on facilitating requests for photography or graphics by our internal staff or our creative partners."     </p>
      
      <p>Corbis Media Management handles a wide variety of digital assets including photography, video, audio, presentations, logos, PDFs, CAD files and sales materials.  The hosted platform is a proven, highly scalable marketing solution that improves workflow and helps maximize the efficiency of any company's marketing team by freeing them up to be marketers, not distributors of company assets. </p>
      
      <p>AvreaFoster, a Dallas-based advertising agency, needed to deploy a Media Management platform for their clients and found that Corbis was the best choice. With a breadth of features, great flexibility and reasonable cost, Corbis was the obvious choice for a solution. The agency has chosen to partner with Corbis Media Management in order to offer the solution to clients as part of its branding services.</p>
      
      <p>"The Corbis Media Management solution allows us to offer our clients a more complete package of services that gives us a competitive differentiator in the market place," said Dave Foster, President and CEO, AvreaFoster.</p>

      <p>Intergraph, a leading global provider of Spatial Information Management (SIM) software, depends on Corbis Media Management to share and distribute logos and product photos with its clients and partners. Corbis Media Management has helped Intergraph create a more efficient marketing environment by providing the company with a hosted, online solution for its digital assets, thus eliminating the issues associated with installing and maintaining a software application for all of their offices.</p>

      <p>"We considered several solutions that would enable us to share our logos and images among our global offices," said Sarah Durling, art director, Intergraph.  "We selected Corbis Media Management because they offered a solution that was efficient and helped us save on resources." </p>

      <p>As a secure, web-accessible solution, the Corbis Media Management platform enables customers to avoid the hassle and expense of software and hardware installation and system maintenance, while giving users the flexibility to expand the service as their needs evolve. Corbis employs daily system backups, robust security, and a 99.5 percent uptime guarantee that its clients' assets will always be accessible.</p>

      <p>"These forward-thinking organizations are turning to innovative solutions that enable them to better manage their media assets, streamline the creative workflow and expedite the brand approval process," said Jon Schupp, Vice President, Media Management Services, Corbis.  "They also have a leg up on the competition by staying in control of their brand voice while being able to localize ad and marketing materials quickly and easily as needed." </p>

    <EventDesc>Corbis Unveils Packed Schedule at Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Commitment to Cannes Reinforces Corbis' Position as Leading Creative Resource for the Advertising Industry as Company Focuses on Best Pictures, Period</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>SEATTLE (June 5, 2007)  - </b>Corbis today announced a packed sponsorship and activity schedule for the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival 2007, showcasing the company's commitment to providing the advertising community with leading creative resources including imagery, footage and Rights Services.
      </p>

      <p>"It's important to help recognize the creative talent and tremendous work over the past year, which has really seen some standout advertising from agencies around the world," said Gary Shenk, incoming CEO, Corbis. "We are here to celebrate great work as a partner that helps creatives, from start to finish, bring their ideas to life with the best pictures, footage and Rights Services."</p>

      <p>Corbis is celebrating its third consecutive year as the exclusive entertainment sponsor for the Festival.  Corbis will host both the Opening and Closing Gala events, two of the most prestigious international advertising events held each year.</p>

      <p>Additionally, demonstrating its commitment to nurturing the next generation of greats, Corbis is sponsoring the Roger Hatchuel Academy.  Tristan Eaton, artist and the curator of the Thunderdog Collective, a project supported by Corbis engaging artists from the worlds of street art, graphic design, illustration, urban vinyl and designer toys to create new works to be licensed exclusively through Corbis, will be one of the key speakers at the Academy, along with Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis.</p>

      <p>Following the resounding success in 2006, Corbis is once again placing its ‘Corbis Creativity Café' at the heart of its activities in Cannes.  Located at the Majestic Hotel, across from the Palais des Festivals, the stunning space will be the ideal location for Lions visitors to pick up a smoothie to revive flagging spirits, send emails back to the office or simply relax and nurse a hangover.</p>

      <p>Building on the entertainment theme, a stunning Corbis Outline exhibition celebrating the celebrity portraiture of Denis Rouvre, a Corbis Outline photographer, will be showcased throughout Cannes during the Festival. Entitled "Cannes fait le mur" the exhibition is designed to highlight the bond between the city of Cannes and globally acclaimed actors, with more than 15 giant billboards and posters of international celebrities displayed throughout the city until July 15th.  Elijah Wood, Alain Delon, Kevin Bacon, Samuel L.Jackson, Diane Kruger, Rosy de Palma, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks et Maiwenn will be displayed on the rue d'Antibes, and Emma de Caunes, Vincent Cassel, Gaspard Ulliel, Morgan Freeman, Jean Dujardin et Marion Cotillard will be seen throughout other parts of the city.</p>

      <p>Corbis is also hosting an exclusive, invite-only evening event for clients in partnership with SonyBMG and Creativity magazine at the Majestic on Thursday 21st June with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter John Legend performing live.</p>

      <p>Corbis will also award the winner of "Da Leone", its competition for Italian advertising agency creatives designed to showcase creative talent and the quality of Corbis imagery.  In February 2007, Corbis set a brief challenging the agencies to devise a press campaign using only Corbis shots to promote a fictional hair care product ‘FORFOCOLOR'.  With the unique prize of an exclusive accommodation on the ‘Corbis Creative Boat' and accreditations for the festival, the lucky winning team will certainly be enthusiastic to participate in Cannes Lions 2007.</p>

    <EventDesc>Corbis Adds Celebrity Portraiture of Michel Comte to Outline Collection</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>For the First Time Ever, Comte's Famed Photography Now Easily Available through Exclusive Partnership with Corbis Outline</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>LONDON (May 15, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced that it will license the photography of Michel Comte through its distinguished Corbis Outline collection, providing exclusive access to Comte's acclaimed work for the first time ever to media, advertising and marketing professionals worldwide.  The partnership agreed with I-Management on behalf of Comte makes hundreds of his celebrity and fashion images available via Corbis Outline effective today, and hundreds more will be added over the coming months.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comte, one of the world's most sought-after photographers of his generation, is an accomplished and prolific fashion, celebrity and photojournalism photographer with a career spanning nearly 30 years.  His fashion shots and portraits of stars have made him famous around the globe, as has his photo journalism including moving close-ups of people and of children from Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia, amongst countless others.
      </p>

      <p>
       Comte has photographed many of the world's biggest celebrities from the worlds of art, entertainment and sports including Sophie Marceau, Isabella Rossellini, Lucy Liu, Whitney Houston, Catharine Deneuve, Tina Turner, Vanessa Mae, Julian Schnabel, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Mike Tyson, Michael Schumacher and a host of others.  Some of the most widely recognized celebrity portraiture to be available on Corbis Outline include iconic images of Helena Christensen, Roger Federer, Heidi Klum and Robbie Williams.

       "Comte's portraits of stars and supermodels are unsurpassed masterpieces," said Beate Chelette, Senior Director of Photography, Entertainment.  "Empathic and glamorous at once, he reveals their strength and celebrates their beauty in brilliantly composed and deeply felt images.  The addition of Comte's work to Corbis Outline further strengthens the quality and depth of our renowned collection."
        </p>

      <p>
        Born in Switzerland, Comte received his first advertising assignment in 1979.  Since then, he has become one of the most sought-after and prolific photographers in the industry, commissioned for campaigns by global brands including Armani, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Nike, Lancôme, Revlon, Ferrari, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz.  Comte continues to be one of the world's most influential fashion photographers and has portrayed numerous celebrities for such magazines as Vogue and Vanity Fair. Comte also photographs on behalf of the International Committee of Red Cross and is founder and President of Michel Comte Water Foundation, devoted to providing access to clean drinking water in countries where it is not easily available. 
        </p>

      <p>
        "This is the first time that Comte's work is being represented globally and made available through the internet, and our objective is to partner with a collection such as Corbis Outline that can offer global reach with unrivalled specialist celebrity expertise," said Suzanne Speich, Managing Director, I-Management.  "Corbis Outline is the undisputed leader in quality personality portraiture and the right fit for Comte's work."
        </p>

      <p>
        Corbis' inspired Personalities portfolio includes Outline, Outline@Home, the recently announced OutlineLive and red-carpet Entertainment collections.

    <EventDesc>Corbis Reinvents Accessibility to Celebrity Photography with Launch of OutlineLive</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>New Collection Features High-Quality Candid Celebrity Portraiture That Can Be Quickly Priced and Licensed Online and Used For Any Editorial Purpose Without Publicist Restrictions</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>SEATTLE (May 8, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced the launch of OutlineLive, a contemporary and fresh collection of celebrity photography featuring high-quality, candid celebrity portraiture that is faster and easier to license and is accessible for any editorial use, including online.  The innovative offering launches worldwide today and will feature more than 35,000 images from the world's leading celebrity photographers by the end of the month.
      </p>

      <p>
        The demand for celebrity and entertainment imagery continues to soar.  Entertainment and celebrity pages in magazines have grown by about 15 percent annually since 2001, and celebrity images now represent nearly half of all magazine covers. The top five celebrity magazines in the United States now sell a combined five million copies on newsstands each week.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result of this growth, publishers are demanding accessible and flexible high-end celebrity portraiture.  The new OutlineLive collection is the first offering on the market to meet this need by making unique, quality celebrity portraits available and accessible for all editorial uses. OutlineLive has no publicist restrictions, can be priced and licensed immediately on Corbis.com and can be published anywhere, including on the Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        "As the spotlight on celebrity has become ever brighter in recent years, getting access to unique quality celebrity photos grows ever more important," said Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief, Total Film and Sky Movies, two of the leading publications in the U.K., with a combined readership in excess of 4 million.  "Corbis already provides us with a lot of excellent photography, and OutlineLive should provide a fresh additional approach for illustrating our editorial coverage." 
        </p>

      <p>
        Corbis has taken a novel approach to the celebrity photography in OutlineLive, creating a collection of informal celebrity portraiture taken in controlled shoots that capture emotive, intimate and playfully spontaneous moments in relevant settings.  The collection includes fresh images from events as recent as the Tribeca Film Festival and the Coachella Music Festival in California. 
        </p>

      <p>
        OutlineLive's collection will continue to grow with fresh photography taken onsite at exclusive events such as film and music festivals and in other casual settings around the world as well as through the addition of content from world-leading photographers.
        </p>

      <p>
        "OutlineLive creates an entirely new and innovative middle market offering that is higher in quality than red carpet shots and easier to access than our exclusive flagship Outline celebrity portraiture," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis. "OutlineLive is a quality, less restrictive, price-conscious collection that provides our clients with natural, revealing and unexpected celebrity imagery that they can use to enhance their covers, feature stories and online editions."
      </p>
      <p>
        OutlineLive is the latest addition to Corbis' inspired Personalities portfolio, with its market-leading Outline, Outline@Home and red-carpet Entertainment collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corbis Outline continues to feature originality and glamour at its best. Outline is the leader in the highest quality in-studio celebrity portraiture the world has to offer from the world's best photographers. This collection offers iconic images that exude style, imagination and prestige and have highly-exclusive usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outline@Home is a look at living well and the homes and lifestyles of the rich and famous. This collection includes exclusive, high quality photos that capture cutting edge design and style, and the work of the most renowned architects, designers and interior designers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corbis Entertainment offers timely, relevant images from select entertainment and fashion events worldwide including celebrities on the red carpet, award ceremonies, movie premieres, fashion show catwalks and parties.  It includes coverage by Corbis photographers plus media partners including Reuters and epa.

		<EventDesc>Corbis Helps Hallmark Turn Up The Volume On Sound Cards</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Hallmark Chooses Corbis to Help Acquire Music and Entertainment Content </i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (May 2, 2007) - </b> Corbis announced today it is working with Hallmark Cards, Inc. to continue to make the company's new product development efforts a reality. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Corbis has been working closely with Hallmark to handle the talent rights acquisition and music clearances for Hallmark's line of sound cards which feature CD-quality recordings of original music and sound clips by the original artists and actors who recorded them.</p>
      
      <p>The collection now features more than 250 cards and more than 100 original music artists including Willie Nelson, the Rolling Stones, Tim McGraw, Smash Mouth and Wang Chung, as well as dialogue and theme songs from popular movies and TV shows such as "Napolean Dynamite," "I Love Lucy" and "Happy Days."   </p>
      
      <p>"Corbis is a perfect fit for this job," said Teddi Hernandez, licensing director for Hallmark.  "They understand our creative vision and have the Hollywood and global entertainment industry connections, as well as rights and music clearance experience to deliver the content. Corbis helps us navigate unfamiliar waters, avoid roadblocks and unnecessary risks."</p>
      
      <p>Hallmark approached Corbis with their creative idea soon after the "Say It With Music" collection of cards was launched. This was followed by the expansion of sound cards to movies and popular television shows. Record labels, as well as movie studios and media companies, were eager to participate as they recognized the opportunity for new revenue.</p>

		<EventDesc>Corbis Enhances Offering To Better Serve Interactive and Mobile Markets</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Innovative Image Licensing and New Collection Help Advertising, Marketing and Editorial Professionals Create Interactive and Mobile Work Easier and More Cost-Effectively</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (April 12, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced industry-leading Rights Managed (RM) licensing enhancements and a new RM and Royalty-Free (RF) Backgrounds &amp; Objects collection to better serve the needs of marketing and editorial professionals creating online and mobile campaigns and editorial content.  The innovations are already making it faster, easier and more cost-effective for creative professionals at leading interactive advertising agencies such as Digitas as well as corporations and media companies to obtain the visual content they need to bring their ideas to life.</p>
			<p>Corbis is adding new packaged options to its existing RM licensing model to streamline licensing content for advertising and broadcast channels associated with the Internet, incorporating Web-only video commercials, Webisodes and mobile device advertisements.  In addition, Corbis is combining traditional television commercial usage with web and mobile uses so advertisers can more cost-effectively extend broadcast campaigns to the Internet and mobile devices.</p>
			<p>"In the past, when we wanted to license a ‘hero' image for broadcast as well as interactive use, we would most likely have to have two sets of RM licenses," said Lisa Oropallo, Associate Director of Art Buying, Digitas.  "These new enhancements make it easier for us to extend the use of an image from broadcast campaigns to the Internet, saving us both time and money."</p>
			<p>Corbis is also introducing a rich and diverse RM and Royalty-Free (RF) Objects &amp; Backgrounds collection created for online advertising, marketing and editorial use.  It is a centralised easy-to-search collection of more than 30,000 images of common objects and backgrounds typically used for e-cards, screen savers and web décor including metaphors, backgrounds and galleries.  It is a conceptual collection with a wide variety of both creative execution and subject matters.  The imagery is clean, often on white backgrounds, with subject matter that is easy to cut out and quickly add on a webpage or in a small size. Corbis will continue to add thousands of new images on a quarterly basis.</p>
			<p>"The advertising and media industries are transforming rapidly, and Corbis has been working closely with creative and editorial professionals to understand their emerging needs," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis. "We are committed to being at the forefront of innovation, and we've carefully tailored these offerings to ensure we're providing creative professionals with the right imagery and pricing that they need to succeed." </p>

		<EventDesc>Corbis Announces Plan to Promote Gary Shenk to CEO </EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Long-standing leader Steve Davis to transition to Senior Advisor role to make time to pursue new challenges</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE, USA (April 10, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced that as of 1 July 2007, Gary Shenk, President of Corbis, will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer.  After 14 years with the company, 10 as CEO, Steve Davis, will transition out of a day-to-day role to pursue new leadership opportunities in the public service and philanthropic world. The company announced a carefully planned transition process, endorsed by the Chairman of Corbis, Bill Gates, to ensure that there is a smooth and orderly transfer of Davis' daily responsibilities. The company said that Davis will continue to serve as a senior advisor beyond June 2007.
      </p>
			<p>"I want to thank Steve for his tremendous contributions to Corbis", said Bill Gates, Chairman, Corbis. "Corbis was created as much by Steve as by me, since he and I first collaborated when the company was in its infancy.  Steve's vision, entrepreneurial skills, industry leadership and global management capabilities have transformed it from one of the earliest internet start-ups, to a global brand with industry-leading growth and services.  Today, Corbis has become the definitive creative resources company helping creative professionals in advertising, marketing and media to succeed in bringing their work to life." 
      </p>
			<p>"Gary is a natural leader and an ideal person to assume the role of CEO", said Gates.  "He has the energy, focus, discipline and proven track record to maximise Corbis' assets by further improving business operations and fostering innovation to best serve customers." 
      </p>
			<p>Today's announcement continues a leadership succession process that has been underway for more than a year. As part of the plan to ensure strategy and knowledge transfer, Shenk was promoted to President of Corbis in November 2006, assuming responsibility for marketing, sales and the creative services businesses including rights and music clearances, rights representation, artist representation and media management.  As Corbis proceeds with the smooth transition plan, all Corbis officers will report to Gary in his role as president, as of today.  
      </p>
			<p>"The opportunity before us has never been greater", said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis.  "We have strategically invested in acquiring and creating the best pictures, built the most comprehensive rights services offering and expanded our presence and brand globally.  We are well positioned to be the creative partner of choice to our customers around the world and to take Corbis to the next level."
      </p>
			<p>Shenk is widely recognised for emphasising a customer-focused approach to Corbis' business. Since joining Corbis in 2003, Shenk has been instrumental in repositioning Corbis' image licensing business to achieve rapid growth and attain quality leadership in the creative photography market, while expanding a strong editorial and entertainment offering.  He has also been the driving force behind Corbis' industry-leading rights services offerings.
      </p>
			<p>"This was a hard decision for me", said Steve Davis, CEO, Corbis. "I'm very lucky to have many different interests and passions that I feel are important and challenging, and now is the time for me to explore those other interests. As I prepare for this change, I firmly believe the road ahead for Corbis is brighter than ever." 
      </p>
			<p>With Davis' long history of community volunteering, playing significant leadership roles in organisations such as the PATH, United Way, NPower, Technology Alliance, Fred Hutchinson, Lambda Legal Defense, Seattle Foundation and many others, he looks forward to dedicating more professional energy to this sector.
      </p>
			<p>Prior to joining Corbis, Shenk was a founder and general manager of FlixMix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Universal Studios that was one of Hollywood's leading media licensing agencies. Shenk's entrepreneurial talents served him well in Hollywood, where he was instrumental in establishing new licensing formats and brokering deals between studios and talent agencies. Shenk began his relationship with Universal while he was a leader in the media and entertainment practice of The Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Among his other accomplishments, Shenk holds an M.B.A in Finance from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and a B.A in Social Studies from Harvard College.  Shenk, 36, is married with three children.
      </p>
			<p>Corbis, founded by Bill Gates in 1989, provides the industry's richest array of creative resources for advertising and media professionals including creative, editorial and entertainment image and footage licensing, rights and music clearances, rights representation, artist representation and a hosted media management solution.  The company, with more than 1100 employees in 24 cities in 16 countries around the world, reported more than $251 million in revenue in 2006, an 11 percent increase from the previous year.

		<EventDesc>Polsky Films Licenses Rights via Corbis to Bring Einstein to the Big Screen</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>New film to be first-ever to explore the journey of a genius who is today one of the world's most instantly recognizable celebrities</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>LOS ANGELES and SEATTLE (April 3, 2007) - </b> Polsky Films today announced that it has licensed through Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) the exclusive rights to the life story of Albert Einstein from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and also has licensed rights in Einstein's writings and personal letters from Princeton University Press.  Polsky Films, headed by Alan and Gabe Polsky, will produce the first-ever epic motion picture focused on the personal triumphs and tragedies of Einstein, the man who redefined the limits of creativity and imagination.  Polsky Films also announced that Walter Isaacson, former managing editor of TIME Magazine, CEO of CNN, and author of Einstein: His Life and Universe, has signed onto the project as a consultant.
      </p>
      <p>Recognized as TIME magazine's "Person of the Century in 2000," Einstein was among the first true global celebrities, and his accomplishments forever changed the course of history and science.  The film will explore the personal struggles felt by a man that the entire world would later look to as an icon, despite Einstein's reluctance to acknowledge his own legend.  A modest man who was aware of his weighty status, Einstein once quipped, "I am no Einstein." </p>
      <p>"We are honoured to be entrusted with telling the story of this amazing individual who has had such a great impact on humanity," said Alan Polsky, Polsky Films.   </p>
      <p>"We are grateful to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Princeton University Press, and Corbis for allowing us to share with the world the complete story of Einstein's profound and inspiring life," said Gabe Polsky, Polsky Films.  "This is a great responsibility, and we will do what it takes to make sure this story is told in a truthful, creative and powerful way." </p>
      <p>Albert Einstein was one of the founders of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, today a leading Research University. Today's announcement reflects an endorsement of the project by both The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the beneficiary of Einstein's intellectual estate and holder of Einstein's intellectual property rights, and Princeton University Press, which oversees the rights to Einstein's collected papers and letters. The comprehensive deal with Corbis includes consultation with leading experts on Einstein, including the Albert Einstein Archives of the Hebrew University, which holds the personal and scientific papers of Einstein.</p>
      <p>"We are confident that Polsky Films is the right team to bring Einstein's story to life because of their incredible passion for and understanding of Einstein," said Martin Cribbs, Director of Rights Representation, Corbis.  "Over the years, we've received a number of inquiries, but Polsky Films' proposal was the one that truly captures the essence of Einstein, an amazing yet complex individual. We are looking forward to having Polsky Films help bring the whole story of Einstein to the big screen."  </p>
      <p>Isaacson, whose book Einstein: His Life and Universe is to be released by Simon &amp; Schuster in April 2007, has signed onto the project as a consultant to provide biographical insight, accuracy and integrity for the film.  Isaacson's biography on Einstein will include information from the 3,500 pages of letters that were recently released by the University, twenty years after the death of his stepdaughter.  </p>
		<p>Corbis exclusively represents Einstein's personality rights on behalf of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and manages the rights for more than 40 other iconic celebrities such as Steve McQueen, The Wright Brothers and Liberace.  In addition to his genius, Einstein's personal appeal, irreverent personality and thoughtful perspective have drawn appeal from every industry and ad sector.  He ranked in the top five of Forbes' list of highest earnings by deceased celebrities in 2006. </p>
		<p>Polsky Films most recently announced teaming with Pressman Films to Produce Chris Buckley's "GOD IS MY BROKER" with scribe Peter Himmelstein attached to adapt.</p>

				<i>Treasured Archive Will Move to New World-Class Facility Outside Paris, France to Ensure It Remains Safe and Accessible for Future Generations</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE and PARIS (February 21, 2007) - </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced that, beginning in 2008, the Sygma collection will have a new long-term home at an advanced, climate controlled preservation facility to be built near Paris, France.

Corbis is collaborating with Locarchives, a proven specialist in archiving and document management, who will build the new "living" archive dedicated specifically to the Sygma collection.  It will be located in Garnay, approximately 45 minutes outside Paris, making it easily accessible for photographers, researchers, historians, iconographers and others professionals interested in consulting the archives in person.  The eight hundred square meter facility will have approximately seven thousand meters of shelving in a climate controlled, airtight environment with advanced fire safety and security protections.  Once opened, the site will be managed by Corbis.  
      </p>
      <p>
Since 2005, a dedicated team of Corbis editors and archivists has been undertaking the initial phases of the "Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative" leading up to the move of the collection.  This has involved changing the archive classification system to classify pictures by photographer rather than by theme to regularize royalties, promote the collection and make it accessible to the public via the digitalization of prints.  
      </p>Next, since the imagery within the Sygma collection is the property of each photographer, Corbis has been contacting the more than 10,000 contributors to offer them an archive agreement confirming that they wish to participate in the archiving and commercial development of their works.  
      <p>Lastly, Corbis is collaborating closely with the photographers to bring the collection to life by searching, identifying and digitizing the most significant photos from the collection to be available via the Corbis website.  Since 2002, Corbis has digitized more than 55,000 pictures to bring the total number available online to 800,000 from the collection. 
      </p>
      <p>The Sygma archive is comprised of nine separate collections of unique photos from the second half of the 20th century.  The 1950s and 1960s imagery includes photography from Apis, Universal Photo, Interpress, Spitzer, Reporter Associés and other agencies.  The collections from the 1970s and beyond includes the prestigious photojournalism, news, magazines, celebrities and portraits from the Sygma photo agency, as well as television and movie set imagery from Kipa, and sporting events from Tempsport.

		<EventDesc>Corbis Announces 2006 Year-End Results</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Company Reports Record Revenue of $251 Million in 2006; Plans Strategic Investments in 2007 Including Launch of Microstock Offering </i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (February 15, 2007) - </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The Company announced total revenues were more than $251 million (2005: $228 million) for the 2006 full-year, outperforming other major companies in the industry with an increase of 11 percent from the previous year on a currency neutral basis.      </p>
      <p>
       "2006 was a significant year for Corbis as we began reaping the benefits of past strategic investments to exceed our cash flow targets and stay on plan toward achieving profitability," said Steve Davis, CEO, Corbis.  "Our continued industry-leading momentum demonstrates that customers are increasingly recognizing Corbis as a creative brand, responding to our market positioning and benefiting from our innovative combination of image licensing and creative services." </p>
      <p><b>2006 Business Highlights</b><br/>
In 2006, Corbis expanded its geographic reach, particularly in Asia, with the opening of an office in Beijing and a new partnership with IndiaPicture.com to better position itself in two of the world's fastest growing economies.  Corbis also acquired Australian Picture Library (APL) to expand its presence in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
Over the past year, the company promoted Gary Shenk to the role of president and completed the realignment of its sales force to customer-focused industry segments.  Corbis also continued to streamline its business operation and integrate systems from past acquisitions to reduce business costs, drive efficiencies, scale for future growth and improve its website and customer service. 
      </p>
      <p>The Company maintained its focus on providing customers with the world's leading collection of creative imagery and motion footage, adding nearly a half million new images and thousands of hours of motion footage to its collections. Corbis began representing content from leading collections such as Playboy, the Smithsonian Institution, Hollywood Licensing, dick clark productions as well as key niche partners, and it acquired BeateWorks to enhance its preeminent CorbisOutline entertainment collection.  The Company also invested heavily in the production of wholly owned Rights Managed (RM) and Royalty-Free (RF) imagery and motion footage.
      </p>
      <p><b>Platforms for Growth in 2007</b><br/>
Building on our heritage of innovation, Corbis in 2007 is making strategic investments to drive growth.  The Company remains focused on providing the best content in the industry.  Corbis' experienced in-house Creative Intelligence department is helping to guide teams of talented photographers and video producers around the world to generate high quality RF and RM content that is relevant to what customers are seeking.  Corbis will also further enhance its world leading collection of photography and improve its motion footage collection by actively pursuing new partners across the content spectrum.  
      </p>
      <p>Corbis is focusing on expanding the scope, depth and geographic reach of its industry-leading Rights Services offerings, including introducing a tailored solution to meet the needs of the broadcast advertising community, expanding the geographic reach of its Rights &amp; Music Clearances team and working more closely with corporate customers to help them leverage entertainment content for new product innovation.  
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, Corbis will launch an innovative entry into the emerging microstock space, full details of which the Company will announce in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
      <p>"We are optimistic about the year ahead and are focused on three growth priorities: building the best pictures period, enhancing our industry-leading Rights Services and launching a fresh microstock offering," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis.  "We're excited to enter the microstock space, and we view it as an attractive, complementary business given our assets and expertise.  We plan on building a substantial, fast-growing and profitable business in this category."</p>

		<EventText>

				<i>Treasured Images from America's Heritage and Contemporary Culture Become Available for Editorial and Commercial Use</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (January 24, 2007) - </b> Corbis, a world leading digital media provider,  (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>)today announced it will begin licensing widely-recognized digital imagery for the Smithsonian Institution, allowing creative professionals a one stop venue to access photography and images of famous objects in American history and contemporary culture.  
      </p>
      <p>
This is the first time that the Smithsonian Institution, one of the world's preeminent cultural organisations with 19 museums and galleries, is working with a visual content provider to license the breadth and depth of its imagery for editorial and commercial use worldwide. It includes a broad spectrum of imagery, from historical photography, cultural objects, paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, scientific instruments, and natural specimens, to aircraft and space vehicles.  
      </p>
      <p>
"Corbis is proud to work with the world-class Smithsonian Institution to bring its impressive catalogue to the global marketplace," said Steve Davis, CEO, Corbis. "Images from the Smithsonian compliment our other famous collections from Andy Warhol, The National Gallery London, zefa, The Bettmann Collection and others to ensure Corbis is the best place for advertisers, marketers and the editorial community to find the superior imagery they need to succeed."
      </p>
      <p>
The partnership plans to provide hundreds of images from Smithsonian museums such as the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Air and Space Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Museum African Art, the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the National Museum of the American Indian.  
      </p>
      <p>
"We are excited to be working with Corbis, a global leader in image licensing, to expand access to Smithsonian's vast archival resources and offer images that have never before been available in high quality digital format. " said Gary Beer, CEO Smithsonian Business Ventures. "The capabilities of Corbis, relationships with editorial and commercial clients, and reputation for high quality, were all reasons that we have chosen to work with them.  We expect this partnership will foster a stronger global awareness for the Institution and its archives, and generate important revenue that supports its educational mission."
      </p>
      <p>
The first of the Smithsonian images have recently been added to Corbis.com with plans to increase the numbers significantly by the end of 2007. Imagery available includes Charles E. "Chuck" Yeager's Bell X-1, Alexander Graham Bell's invention, the telephone, and the 45.52-carat Hope Diamond.

		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>"Thunderdog Collective" Will Feature Work from Street Art, Graphic Design, and Illustration Artists and Will Be Available Exclusively Through Corbis</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>New York City (December 18, 2006)-- </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced the launch of a new partnership with Thunderdog Studios and its President and Creative Director, Tristan Eaton, a New York-based artist.

			</p>
			<p>The announcement was made at a V.I.P. launch and charity fundraising event at The Showroom NYC in New York City's East Village on Friday, December 15th.   At the event, a mural created by Eaton at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in June, 2006, as well as a number of designer toys, were auctioned off, with proceeds benefiting Americans for the Arts, the nation's leading nonprofit organization for advancing the arts in America. 
			</p>
			<p>"I'm thrilled to continue working with Corbis to develop groundbreaking, creative works of art," said Tristan Eaton. "It's important for the artists in the Thunderdog Collective to have the creative freedom Corbis provides as well as the opportunity to reach a broader audience." 
         </p>

	    </p>		
		<p>"As outsiders and innovators, the artists highlighted in the Thunderdog Collective are examples of artists that cross multiple mediums and are redefining the art world today with collaborative works in painting and designer toys," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. "This partnership provides artists the room to create innovative work, the ability to make their work accessible to a broad community of creatives and consumers, and the security of copyright protection."
		</p>
        <p>More than three hundred new and original images will be available for advertising, editorial and product licensing, starting in January, 2007 exclusively through Corbis.  Hundreds more will be created and added to the collection every few months throughout the year from both famous names within the community as well as new up-and-coming artists.  The collection will demonstrate the breadth of style and creative innovation among leading contemporary artists immersed in the culture of street art, toy design and emerging art mediums.  The distinct styling of these artists will continue to evolve as artists in the Collective explore new forms, techniques and topics. 
         </p>
         <p>Work from the Thunderdog Collective will be on display at The Showroom NYC (<a href="http://www.theshowroomnyc.com">www.theshowroomnyc.com</a>) from December 15th through January 15th, alongside the mural that was auctioned at the opening event to benefit Americans for the Arts.
         </p>
         <p>"We appreciate Tristan and Corbis demonstrating their commitment to advancing the arts by donating the proceeds of the auction to Americans for the Arts," said Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts. "The funds will go to programmes that encourage an appreciation and understanding of the arts that benefits us all."

    <EventDesc>Corbis Announces Financial Award for Pro Bono Creative Work</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p><i>Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award will honour pro bono work in professional and student categories at ADC 86th Annual Awards</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE, Washington -- October 27, 2006 </b>Corbis announced today its global signature community relations programme, the <i>Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award</i>, to honour innovative digital media work produced for a non-profit organisation on a pro bono basis.  The award is part of a special partnership with the Art Directors Club (ADC) and will be presented at the ADC 86th Annual Awards Gala on May 31, 2007. </p>
      <p>
The professional award comes with a $20,000 cash prize presented to the non-profit client for whom the winning work was produced.  In addition, Corbis will present a $5,000 scholarship to the winning student work created for a non-profit group.
       </p>
      <p>
"A commitment to social justice has been at the core of our company's beliefs from the very beginning", said Steve Davis, CEO of Corbis.  "We are delighted to partner with the ADC because they share our interests in the passion that drives creative work and the results that come from powerful communication on important social issues."
      </p>
      <p>
"To my knowledge, this is the first time cash awards have been offered in connection with ADC's Annual Awards competition," said ADC executive director Myrna Davis. "We are excited to participate in this initiative because the Corbis prizes benefit non-profit causes and education, in keeping with our mission."
      </p>
      <p>
Since 2004, Corbis has helped hundreds of creatives working for nonprofit organisations by waiving licensing fees on images from the Bettmann Archives, one of the world's largest and oldest collections of photographic images, with approximately 11 million images ranging from iconic pictures of human history to depictions of everyday life.  The company also supports charitable industry programmes throughout its offices worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
Work considered for the <i>Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award</i> will comprise winners in any non-profit category in the ADC competition that was created on a pro bono basis.  This includes Advertising, Design, Interactive Media and Hybrid and everything from print to out-of-home, integrated campaigns, television, guerilla marketing, interactive media, annual reports, brochures, publication design, packaging, photography and illustration.  The final recipient will be decided by ADC's Hybrid jury, made up of jury chairs and selected members from the Advertising, Design and Interactive Media juries.
	</p>
	<p>
All eligible professional entries must have been printed, published, broadcast, or presented online for the first time between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006, in any country.  Entries may be submitted by any company or individual involved in the creation or production of the work.  Student entries must be created with an existing non-profit organisation in mind, but the public production requirement is waived.
	</p>
	<p>
ADC and Corbis plan a fall 2007 seminar to showcase the winning work and to publicise resources available to those interested in creating pro bono work.  Corbis and the ADC will also host a series of exhibitions in North America, Europe and Asia to showcase the ADC awards.

		<EventDesc>Corbis Assignment Photographer Lynsey Addario Wins Fujifilm Young Photographer's Award 2005 </EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<b>Perpignan, France (2 September 2005)</b> – Corbis assignment photographer Lynsey Addario has been awarded the Fujifilm Young Photographer's Award for "The Wounded," her coverage of medical treatment of American soliders injured while serving in Iraq.  The award was presented at the 17th annual Visa pour l'Image international photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France.  
         </p>
			<p>
"This award is important to me on a personal level because it validates my work as a photojournalist," said Lynsey Addario, Corbis assignment photographer.  "Often I go long stretches working without much feedback from a broad audience, so it's very inspiring to have these images recognized in such an important international forum."
         </p>
			<p>
"Lynsey is part of the new generation of photojournalists that are reflecting today's changing world with responsibility, humanity, and talent," said Maria Mann, Worldwide Director of News Photography.  "Her win of the Fujifilm Young Photographer's Award is a tribute to her commitment and dedication to the profession."
         </p>
			<p>
Addario, exclusively represented by Corbis, photographed the series in November 2004 at hospitals at the Balud Air Base and in Landstuhl, Germany and at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, DC.  The winning photography series, originally commissioned by LIFE Magazine, was published in the The New York Times Magazine in March 2005.
         </p>
			<p>
Photographs from "The Wounded" are available upon request.
         </p>
			<p>
				<b>About "The Wounded"</b>
				<br/>Last November, Lynsey Addario spent one week documenting the medical treatment of American soldiers injured while serving in Iraq. Addario began the assignment for LIFE Magazine at the Air Force Theater Hospital at Balad Air Base.  She accompanied troops on a cargo plane bound for a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, finally arriving at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, DC. The number of casualties had increased exponentially due to the US military's assault on Fallujah, counter-insurgency operations, and insurgent attacks throughout the country. The New York Times Sunday Magazine published a portfolio of the work in March 2005. 
         </p>

      <EventDesc>Second win of red dot award confirms Corbis CROP photo catalog series to be industry's best tool for inspiration</EventDesc>
      <EventText>
         <p>
            <i>Large-format catalog series continues to win highest distinction for communication design</i>
         </p>
         <p>
        <b>SEATTLE, Washington (August 22, 2005)</b> – The Corbis CROP photo catalog series, designed by world-famous designer Carlos Segura, has been awarded the "red dot award: best of the best" in Communication Design for the latest catalogs, entitled CROP5 and CACP Assigmment.  Corbis, a leading provider of image licensing, assignment, and rights services, has established the large-format CROP catalog as an artistic tool that serves to excite creativity and inspiration.  The series was awarded "best of the best" and red dot: grand prix in 2004.   
         </p>
         <p>
"It is a pleasure to have such creative freedom provided by Corbis," explains Carlos Segura. "Our partnership enables my team to produce work that contributes to strengthening Corbis' reputation in the creative environment. The red dot award is the best recognition for our joint work and represents a highlight among the goals we have set ourselves."
         </p>
         <p>
CROP was conceived to dramatically demonstrate the evolution of the catalog from a book containing thousands of images to a tool that served to inspire creative thinking.  Since its inception, the series has received worldwide acknowledgement from the creative industry, including the 2005 HOW International Design Annual, 2004 Communications Arts Design Annual, AIGA 365, and the Tokyo Type Directors Club. The catalog series, printed in a limited edition of 30,000 with specially designed packaging, incorporates timeless and inspirational selections from Corbis´extensive news, creative, celebrity, historical, and art collections.  It is particularly well-regarded for its unusually broad array of papers and printing techniques, its range of content themes, and its exceptional pictures – all designed to visually inspire conceptual creativity.
         </p>
         <p>
zefa's portfolio book, ‘Connected,' has also won a red dot for communication design, further demonstrating that these catalog alternatives have become desirable design items in their own right.  zefa was acquired by Corbis in January 2005.
         </p>

		<EventDesc>Corbis' Apple®-A-Day Giveaway Contest Wins the 2005 AME Gold Medallion Award</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<Paragraph/>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (February 1, 2005)</b>–The Apple®-A-Day Giveaway Contest from Corbis, a leading provider of complete visual solutions, was recognized today as the Gold Medallion winner in the Integrated Marketing category at the 2005 AME Awards for Advertising and Marketing Effectiveness.
         </p>
			<p>
Corbis' Apple®-A-Day Giveaway Contest was a promotion that offered creative professionals an opportunity to be entered to win an Apple® G5 tower and 23" monitor simply by logging onto the Corbis website each day in April 2004 by noon.  Apple®-A-Day included a unique mix of print, online, and guerilla marketing tactics, including double page spreads in 30 global trade and fashion publications, sidewalk art, posters, boxes with Corbis branded apples, heat-activated coffee mugs, tee shirts, and daily teaser emails. These tactics were executed in United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong.
         </p>
			<p>
Created by Corbis' agency-of-record, Bondo &amp; Remer (Seattle), Apple®-A-Day was successful on multiple fronts.  During the two-month campaign, Corbis added more than 40,000 new accounts, average daily log-in traffic increased by 300%, and research requests increased by 30%.  From this rise in customer activity, Apple®-A-Day generated incremental 2004 revenue from new customers exceeding $6MM. 
         </p>
			<p>
"The Apple®-A-Day Giveaway Contest campaign was designed with a single objective, to interrupt the patterns and habits of creative professionals and encourage them to form a new habit – starting their day with Corbis,'' said Joe Barrett, Corbis vice president of marketing. "I always ask ‘So what?' when designing marketing activities, and creatives told us by their change in behavior and spending that Apple®-A-Day was a resounding success."
         </p>
			<p>
"Our goal for Apple-A-Day was simple -- to get customers to logon to the Corbis website first thing each morning.  By creating that habit, we felt we could increase top-of-mind awareness of Corbis when those customers were actually looking for images,'' said Dave Remer, CEO and creative director, Bondo &amp; Remer.  "The strategy worked, and at the same time, it reinforced the Start Here tagline while maintaining the playful voice of the brand."
         </p>
			<p>
The team credited for the campaign included: Joe Barrett, Corbis vice president of marketing; Robson Grieve, Corbis director of marketing; Dave Remer, CEO &amp; creative director, Bondo &amp; Remer; Chris Harwood, creative director/copywriter, Bondo &amp; Remer; and Andrea Jones, vice president of strategy &amp; client services, Bondo &amp; Remer.

				<i>Corbis CEO Steve Davis Announces Global Expansion into Six New Markets and Launches Rights Representation Service</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>NEW YORK (January 19, 2005)</b>–Corbis, a leading provider of complete visual solutions, announced today that its 2004 revenues surpassed $170 million. The announcement was made at the company's annual meeting, at which Corbis CEO Steve Davis and founder Bill Gates addressed an audience of more than 350 media and publishing executives, journalists and industry analysts. 
         </p>
			<p>
Corbis reported $170.4 million in revenue, representing growth of approximately 22% over 2003 revenues of approximately $140 million. Recently-acquired zefa visual media group reported approximately $41 million (33 million Euro) in revenue. Davis estimated the two companies' combined 2004 revenues at approximately $211 million.
         </p>
			<p>
"We have experienced strong growth across all our lines of business. Our strategy of offering complete visual solutions, encompassing existing imagery, rights services and assignment and representation, has gained tremendous traction with the market.  2004 revenues are the highest in Corbis history," said Davis. "Today's creative professionals want exceptional imagery combined with the services necessary to use them in innovative ways—which is why more advertising and publishing clients start with Corbis for their visual projects then ever before." 
         </p>
			<p>
Corbis' revenue in the Americas grew at a rate of 18%, and international revenue grew at almost twice that rate, with European revenue growing 31%, Asian 51%, and Japanese 57%. Non-US sales accounted for approximately 42% of Corbis' revenues. With the zefa acquisition, Davis predicted continued growth in excess of 40% for 2005. Corbis also expects positive cash flow from operations in 2005.
