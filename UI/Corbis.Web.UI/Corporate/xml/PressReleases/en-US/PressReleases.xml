        <i>
          Interactive photographic display celebrates fall of the Berlin Wall
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>London (August 27 2008) - </b>Corbis, a leading visual media provider for the creative community, today announced that its photography will be displayed at the upcoming 'Create Berlin Goes London' exhibition. Corbis imagery will be used as part of a creative concept designed by two German agencies, Magma Brand Design and Xplicit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking place one year ahead of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the exhibition celebrates the explosion of creativity and openness that resulted from the Wall's collapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this event, the theme 'Berlin - creative metropolis' will be illustrated by 20 top design concepts. These concepts were selected by a jury from over 70 submissions from German agencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amongst these successful submissions is 'Off Limits' created by Magma Brand Design and Xplicit. The work is based on a 3.5 metre cube through which visitors can walk. The outside of the cube will feature black and white images, derived from the extensive Corbis archives including Corbis, Corbis Sygma and Corbis Reuters. These images depict borders, barbed wires, fences and refugees. On the inside of the cube, text will be projected onto the wall to reinforce the 'Off Limits' message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Siri Vorbeck, Creative Director of Photography at Corbis says: "The historical images were selected because they reinforce the feeling of repression and isolation. We wanted to remind visitors of the unspeakable sorrow experienced by those people living in Berlin after the Wall was constructed."
      </p>

      <p>
        The exhibition will kick off on 18th September with an introduction by Klaus Wowereit, the Mayor of Berlin. This three-day exhibition will be held at the Dray Walk Gallery at Truman Brewery, Brick Lane, East London.

          Acclaimed Celebrity Photographer Jason Joyce Creates Out-of-this-world Look
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LONDON (July 28, 2008) - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a leading visual media provider for the creative community, today announced the addition of futuristic sports imagery to its collection. The imagery by acclaimed photographer Jason Joyce is featured along with photography of iconic athletes, contemporary champions and action shots from a host of leading sporting events on Corbis' sports microsite <a href="http://pro.corbis.com/creative/sports/" target="_blank">www.corbis.com/sports</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new imagery from Joyce features women fencers, swimmers, archers, weight-lifters, soccer players and others in high concept futuristic settings. The images have been carefully retouched to give the photos a clean, vibrant and surreal look.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept and storyboard for the shoot in London was conceived and managed by Corbis Art Director Martin Yates. Joyce designed the set-up and lighting for the shoot so the images would be suitable for the post-production team to manipulate. The retouching was handled at Corbis, and a 3-D designer created the backgrounds using state-of-the-art 3-D imaging software.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Our creative research consistently finds that there is a lot of demand for imagery featuring women in sports, and this new collection celebrates female athletes in a way that is undoubtedly compelling and unique," said Martin Yates, Art Director, Corbis. "The atmosphere for the shoot was inspired by science fiction movies like Aeon Flux and transports us to another time and place."
      </p>

      <p>
        Jason Joyce lives and works in London. He began his career as a fashion photographer before moving into celebrity portraiture. His work has been published in world-leading publications including <i>Interview</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Harpers Bazaar</i> and <i>Q</i>. Recently he has shot advertising campaigns for Mother and McCann Erickson advertising agencies in the UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        "With the summer games in Beijing approaching, we wanted to create something fresh and different that appeals to creatives looking for an alternative vision," said Joyce. "I'm really proud of this work and the way it breaks down preconceived notions of beauty and athletics."

          Clearance Experts Help Pack Celebrity Punch in Ads around the World
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>CANNES, FRANCE (June 19, 2008) - </b>GreenLight, a Corbis company and one of the world's leading Intellectual Property services firms, today announced its rights and music clearances work for advertising campaigns for leading brands such as Old Spice, Ballantine's and American Family Insurance. GreenLight has recently worked with leading advertisings agencies in North America, Europe and Asia including Weiden + Kennedy, Publicis, Element 79, and Y&amp;R. The announcement was made at Cannes Lions 2008, the 55th International Advertising Festival, held June 15-21 in Cannes, France.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weiden + Kennedy of Portland, Oregon turned to GreenLight to help clear a photograph of actress Kim Novak to be used in a print ad for Old Spice deodorant. After W+K's creatives stumbled across the photo in a book of historical celebrity images, GreenLight was able to locate and secure the appropriate copyright so that the advertisement could feature the image of the famous actress along with the memorable tag-line "Blondes Prefer Gentlemen." The ad was initially intended to run just once, but it drew such a positive response that Old Spice extended the campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We knew that the image we discovered would be perfect for our campaign, and GreenLight really came through in quickly handling the clearances for us," said Heather Smith Harvey, Art Buyer, Weiden + Kennedy. "Their involvement helped us create a really fun ad that connected with consumers."
      </p>

      <p>
        GreenLight also worked on behalf of Publicis UK to clear the use of images of John McEnroe, Steve McQueen and other iconic personalities to appear in Ballantine's Whisky advertisements in Spain and Portugal.
      </p>

      <p>
        "GreenLight was a true partner in helping us negotiate rights and clearances for a high-profile Ballantine's whisky campaign," said Stacy Koetsier, Client Director, Publicis. "Their insight into negotiation strategy with well-known celebrities was instrumental in securing the deals and helping us deliver a top-notch advertising campaign."
      </p>

      <p>
        In creating an integrated print, radio, TV, and online campaign for American Family Insurance, ad agency Element 79, based in Chicago, wanted to include iconic American pop culture references. One big challenge was that they were on a tight timeline and it was the 2007 holiday season. Element 79 turned to GreenLight to clear the use of clips from the popular TV shows Green Acres, The Munsters, and The Brady Bunch. With its unrivaled Rolodex of Hollywood contacts, GreenLight cleared the required rights in just three days, allowing Element 79 to present a winning ad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Y&amp;R Jakarta, Indonesia enlisted GreenLight's help in clearing the publishing rights for the song "Que Sera, Sera" for use in a television commercial for Indonesian cement company Holcim. The well-known song, which was a hit for Doris Day in 1956, was given new lyrics and sung in Indonesian. This unlikely pairing of this subject and song proved to be popular across Indonesia and generated good buzz on the Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        "GreenLight's vast experience and connections with these types of clearances made the process a successful one," said Aryanto Nugroho, Group Account Director, Y&amp;R.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We free up creatives to spend more time and energy on developing great concepts," said Mark Sherman, Senior Vice President and Head of GreenLight. "Our mission is to provide airtight clearances quickly and cost-effectively to help great advertising ideas fly."

"The use of Dead Celebs (or as I call them "˜Delebs') such as McQueen, continues to increase in the marketplace. Manufacturers and advertisers license them to strengthen their product lines and brands and appeal to consumers across generations by leveraging personas that are unmatched by the Hollywood stars of today.

      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK (May 30, 2008)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a leading visual media provider for the creative community, today announced that it will begin offering clips from films, outtakes and previously unreleased footage in HD from Maysles Films Corbis (<a href="http://www.mayslesfilms.com/" target="_blank">www.mayslesfilms.com</a>), one of America's most recognized documentary filmmakers. The announcement was made last night during an exclusive screening and book signing of A Maysles Scrapbook: Photographs/Cinemagraphs/Documents with Albert Maysles at Tribeca Cinemas in New York City.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recognized for making some of the world's best known documentaries and character studies including <i>Gimme Shelter, Meet Marlon Brando, With Love from Truman, Salesman, and Grey Gardens</i> the Maysles brothers have captivated audiences around the world for more than 50 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Corbis is re-mastering many of the films as well as unexpected outtakes and personal footage into high quality HD video that may be licensed quickly and easily through Corbis Motion (<a href="http://www.corbismotion.com/" target="_blank">www.corbismotion.com</a>) or a Corbis customer service representative. Many of the outtakes were experiments taken during the filming and reveal new insight into the riveting documentaries.  Corbis Motion will make several hundred clips from films and footage available for preview on its website over the coming months.
      </p>

      <p>
        "As a documentarian, my efforts are directed at fostering public discourse and encouraging better understanding of humanity," said Albert Maysles. "I have spent a lifetime uncovering the power of the truth and romance of discovery, and through this collaboration with Corbis we can happily spread the reach of these works."
      </p>

      <p>
        Two of America's foremost non-fiction filmmakers, Albert Maysles and his brother David Maysles (1932-1987) are recognized as pioneers of "direct cinema," the American version of French "cinema veritÃ©." They earned their distinguished reputations by being the first to make non-fiction feature films that capture the complexity of human life without scripts, sets or narration.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The Maysles are simply among the most talented American documentarians and have given the world an unforgettable cultural legacy," said Skip d'Amico, Director of Motion, Corbis. "The addition of this work speaks to the quality, sophistication and uniqueness of the Corbis Motion collection."
      </p>

      <p>
        Clips from the films will be available for both editorial and commercial use.  All uses will require appropriate rights clearances, which can be handled by Corbis Rights Services. Among the films to be re-mastered over the next 24 months are <i>Meet Marlon Brando, With Love from Truman, Salvador Dali's Fantastic Dream, Psychiatry in Russia, Showman, McGovern, Russian Close Up, Orson Welles in Spain, Salesman, Umbrellas and Grey Gardens.</i>

        Maysles Films has been the leading force in non-fiction film since the 1960's.

Their films, Salesman (1968), Gimme Shelter (1970) and Grey Gardens (1976) stand as acknowledged landmarks in the realm of documentary feature films. Maysles Films, Inc. has conceived and produced more than three dozen films, commissioned and non-commissioned. Their inspiration is forever derived from the drama and truth of the human experience.

        <b>NEW YORK (May 2, 2008)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a leading visual media provider for the creative community, and the Art Directors Club (ADC), today announced the professional and student winners of the 2nd annual Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award &amp; Scholarship, part of the 87th Annual ADC Awards program recognizing the best in advertising and design from around the world. The winners were revealed at the annual ADC Awards Gala held last night at the ADC Gallery in New York City.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award &amp; Scholarship honors the best work created by professionals and students on behalf of non-profits on a pro bono basis. Agency creatives receive the prestigious ADC Cubes, and Corbis donates $20,000 to the non-profit cause and awards the student winner with a $5,000 scholarship. This year, Corbis is inviting the creative community to join the "Search for Justice" and increase Corbis' donation to the social justice causes just by searching for images at <a href="http://www.corbis.com/searchforjustice" target="_blank">www.corbis.com/searchforjustice</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>2008 Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award Winners Strike Gold!</b><br/>
        The professional award this year was a tie, with both winners receiving the ADC's highest honor, the prestigious ADC Gold Cube. The benefiting charitable causes will split the $20,000 prize as well as additional money resulting from Corbis' "Search for Justice" initiative.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We are so thrilled that these winners received the ADC's highest honor "" the ADC Gold Cube," said Renee Martin, Vice President, Sales &amp; Service, North America, who presented the awards to the winners at the ADC Gala. "Corbis is dedicated to supporting the creative community and the non-profit causes that creatives have spent their hard-to-find free time to support. We love recognizing this incredible talent."
      </p>

      <p>
        TAXI Canada was awarded a Gold Cube for a community initiative it conceived and launched called The 15 Below Project(<a href="http://15belowproject.org" target="_blank">http://15belowproject.org</a>) to mark the agency's 15-year anniversary.  TAXI executive creative director, Steve Mykolyn, developed the idea for the high-concept, low-cost jackets to help the homeless who can't get off the streets to survive extreme winter conditions. Stuffed with newspaper it's a winter coat. Stuffing removed, it becomes a raincoat. When not being worn, it converts into a backpack that can be used as a pillow. On behalf of its clients and staff, TAXI Canada donated 3,000 15 Below jackets to the homeless throughout Canada and the U.S.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vitruvio Leo Burnett Spain was awarded a Gold Cube for its pro bono work supporting the Prodis Foundation(<a href="http://www.fundacionprodis.org" target="_blank">www.fundacionprodis.org</a>), which helps those with Down syndrome achieve a more independent lifestyle.  Vitruvio Leo Burnett responded to a brief from Prodis to create a public awareness campaign communicating that children with Down syndrome can be active participants in society. The agency conceived a campaign called "Let Us Do It," whereby children with Down's created and shot an ad and movie trailer themselves to address misconceptions about those with Down syndrome and illustrate their capabilities and skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        James Wang, a student of New York-based School of Visual Arts (SVA), was selected as the Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Scholarship winner for his project based on the Darfur Genocide Campaign (<a href="http://www.savedarfur.org" target="_blank">www.savedarfur.org</a>), an organization dedicated to raising public awareness about the atrocities in Darfur. James' poster campaign expressed the loss of life in Darfur through graphic symbolism and a slogan "˜400,000 killed and still growing.' The artwork consisted of a long succession of posters featuring red check marks, which visually expressed the number of lives lost. The red check marks also became the campaign's logo. While the project was done on behalf of a real non-profit organization, it did not require the participation or consent of the organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It's clear that this award category is driven by passion""from the non-profits to the creatives and full circle back to Corbis," said Ami Brophy, Executive Director of the ADC. "We hope that these awards encourage others to use their creative skills to benefit the non-profit sector and ultimately their communities at large."
      </p>

      <p>

    <EventDesc>Corbis Names New Leadership for Its Prestigious Outline Brand</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Industry Veteran Edie Tobias Rejoins Corbis</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LOS ANGELES  (January 9, 2008)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced that Edie Tobias will rejoin the company to lead its world-renowned celebrity offering, including the Outline, Outline@Home, OutlineLive and Entertainment red-carpet collections.  Tobias is taking over from Beate Chelette, Senior Director of Photography, who successfully led the division for nearly two years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tobias has more than 20 years of experience and is widely respected as an industry expert and advocate for photographers.  This is her second time with the company, having worked at Corbis as a Director of Photography from 2000 to 2005, following its acquisition of Sharpshooters where she was president.  For the past nearly three years, Tobias served as Vice President of Creative Content at Jupiterimages, responsible for the visual direction of its top tier brands. Tobias will continue to be based in Los Angeles.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Edie is widely recognized for her leadership, her ability to embrace great photography and her strong industry relationships," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. "It's great to welcome her back to Corbis to oversee the continued growth of our acclaimed Outline brand."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I am really pleased to return to Corbis," said Tobias. "It is an incredible opportunity to lead Outline and build on the momentum that Corbis has achieved in the celebrity arena over the past couple of years."
      </p>

      <p>
        Tobias is replacing Chelette, who joined Corbis when it acquired her company, Beateworks, in March 2006. Chelette has been instrumental in strengthening Corbis' position, including successfully introducing the breakthrough OutlineLive offering, recruiting acclaimed new photography talent and maintaining strong revenue performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This has been a rewarding past two years, and I am really proud of what we've accomplished as a team," said Chelette.  "Edie is the perfect choice to execute Corbis' long term strategies and will add her signature to the brands. Corbis' quality approach is what customers want, and I know it will be successful."

    <EventDesc>Corbis Enhances Sales and Service to Drive Growth</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Company Announces Plans to Introduce Regional Service Centers and Deploy In-The-Field Teams to Get Closer to Customers</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE (November 14, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced plans to bolster sales capabilities and enhance customer service around the world to drive growth in its Corbis image licensing businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Corbis is already recognized for our world-class customer service, and these improvements build on that heritage," said Gary Shenk, CEO, Corbis. "Transforming our sales organization and customer service operations are critical to making us a more competitive player in the market."
      </p>

      <p>
        The company plans to streamline customer service by introducing convenient, highly responsive regional contact centers in Europe and North America. The new multilingual contact centers will enable the company to better serve all markets where it has operations today while phasing out brick-and-mortar offices in select smaller markets during the first half of 2008.
      </p>

      <p>
        To intensify its focus on the commercial and editorial imagery markets, the company will also deploy highly-connected in-the-field business development teams in most major advertising and media centers in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, expanding its current market-reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        To align its resources with its modernized structure, the company plans to streamline its sales organization and related support functions, resulting in an overall global workforce reduction of approximately 125 positions.  The planned reductions are across most levels of the organization and all geographies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The planned changes follow a comprehensive review of the company's business over the past six months and represent an important step forward towards profitability.  All changes are unrelated to current business performance or to its recent acquisition of Veer, which is not impacted.

    <EventDesc>Ford and Corbis Bullitt McQueen into 2008</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Corbis Licenses the Rights to Ford Motor Company to use Steve McQueen in Association with the Limited Edition of the new Mustang Bullitt</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK (November 8, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced that its Rights Representation division has licensed the rights to Ford Motor Company to use Steve McQueen in association with the limited edition of the new Mustang Bullitt that was revealed this week at a special event in San Francisco, CA, USA. The car is modeled after the Mustang McQueen drove in the iconic motion picture Bullitt in 1968. The deal also includes the use of McQueen for Ford's industry-trade marketing activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The return of Bullitt unites two great legends once again - Steve McQueen and the 2008 Bullitt," said Robert Parker, Ford Car Marketing Manager. "This modern classic delivers a balance of power and performance that only Mustang can do."
      </p>
 
      <p>
        The release of the car coincides with the 40th anniversary of Bullitt, long considered the most legendary car chase film ever made. In the film, McQueen zooms through the streets of San Francisco in a Ford Mustang. The limited edition Ford Mustang Bullitt comes painted in the Dark Highland Green that was featured on the Mustang McQueen drove in the film. Ford plans to only produce 7,700 units.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The new Mustang Bullitt is an instant icon with its legendary associations to Steve McQueen, the epitome of a man's man," said Martin Cribbs, Director of Rights Representation, Corbis. "It's exciting to work with a company like Ford, which has the ability to respectfully revitalize McQueen through the reintroduction of one of the most famous cars in cinematic history."
      </p>

      <p>
        Steve McQueen is an enduring pop culture icon. He lived the American dream, coming from a poor, broken home and growing up to be a Hollywood star. The original celebrity racer, McQueen raced cars and motorcycles and did many of his own stunts in his films. His image is recognized worldwide, his movies are world renowned and he remains the King of Cool in the eyes of fans across generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Corbis' Rights Representation group acts as an exclusive representative to a select group of legendary icons. It is the world's leading provider of Rights Services, and exclusively represents the name, image and likeness of several of the world's most recognized personas including McQueen, Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers and Sigmund Freud. Marketers and product manufacturers in categories including apparels, health &amp; beauty, home furnishing and consumer packaged goods are increasingly using timeless iconic celebrities such as McQueen to strengthen their product lines and brands and appeal to consumers across generations by leveraging personas that are unmatched by the Hollywood stars of today.

    <EventDesc>Corbis Adds Striking Medical Imagery to Collection with New MedicalRF Partnership</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Specialized, Hard-to-find Health and Life Sciences Royalty-Free Imagery Is Affordable, Flexible and Can Be Used Almost Anywhere</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE (October 31, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>),
        a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced the addition of an extensive collection of specialized royalty-free (RF) medical imagery through a new partnership with MedicalRF, the world's largest provider of high quality medical RF images.
      </p>

      <p>
        Effective today, Corbis is offering thousands of powerful and distinct medical and life sciences digital illustrations via its website that cover a range of subjects including microscopic organisms, human anatomy, disease states and medical devices. This is the first time that this extensive and unusual type of imagery is available to be licensed royalty-free through a major global imagery provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Corbis is committed to investing in the preservation of the profoundly important Sygma archive, one of the greatest collections of photojournalism in the world and an invaluable historical record of many momentous events from the past half century," said Stefan Biberfeld, Senior Corporate Council, EMEA, who is overseeing the Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative. "We were proud to recognise the preservation and access work that is being undertaken with a special one night exhibition in London."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Images are often the best way to engage people on health issues and to educate them about preventative care and treatment options," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. "This new collection features digitally produced illustrations that are visually compelling and that make finding appropriate images to illustrate the majority of medical anatomy and concepts a lot easier than ever before."
      </p>

      <p>
        MedicalRF, based in Dublin, Ireland, specializes in digitally creating images that traditional photography cannot produce. The company uses cutting-edge technology to develop realistic and stylized three dimensional (3D) images that are designed particularly for medical anatomy and concepts.  The imagery is so realistic that it is difficult to discern if it is computer-generated or actual photography.
      </p>

      <p>
        Images from the collection are typically licensed for a variety of advertising, educational and other uses by professionals in life sciences, medical, pharmaceutical, biotech advertising and communications industries as well as the editorial and publishing sectors.  The healthcare industry remains one of the fastest growing advertising markets, with spending in the pharmaceutical sector up more than 7 percent in the first half of 2007 according to Nielsen.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This collection specializes in different types of medical images that appeal to different types of customers and meet their individual needs," said Niall Johnston, Vice President of Business Development, MedicalRF. "Some images are more scientific in nature and detail, while some are more conceptual.  The collection generally has medical content to meet the requirements of all market sectors including advertising, marketing, publishing and editorial."

    <EventDesc>Corbis Celebrates Preservation of Renowned Sygma Collection with a One Night VIP Exhibition in London</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Event Recognises Sygma's Move to a New World-Class Facility, Ensuring it Remains Safe and Accessible for Future Generations</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LONDON (October 17, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, last night celebrated its Sygma Preservation Initiative with a special event in London. Begun in 2004, the project will ensure the collections' 50 million objects including slides, negatives, prints and contact sheets are carefully protected in new long-term home at an advanced, climate controlled preservation facility near Paris, while being brought to life and made more widely accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The event, held at The Galleria in Pall Mall, included a selection of some of the most iconic images from the archive including intimate portraits of Alfred Hitchcock, Bob Dylan and Nelson Mandela, harrowing images of war in Chechnya, the Gulf and Rwanda and daring reportage of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre. Two well known Sygma photographers, Richard Smith, winner of the BBC Young Photographer of the Year, and Orde Eliasson, founder of Link Photography, were in attendance for the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Corbis is committed to investing in the preservation of the profoundly important Sygma archive, one of the greatest collections of photojournalism in the world and an invaluable historical record of many momentous events from the past half century," said Stefan Biberfeld, Senior Corporate Council, EMEA, who is overseeing the Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative. "We were proud to recognise the preservation and access work that is being undertaken with a special one night exhibition in London."
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of its work with Sygma, Corbis is collaborating with Locarchives, a proven specialist in archiving and document management, who will build the new "living" archive dedicated specifically to the Sygma collection.  It will be located in Garnay, approximately 45 minutes outside Paris, making it easily accessible for photographers, researchers, historians, iconographers and others professionals interested in consulting the archives in person.  The eight hundred square meter facility will have approximately seven thousand meters of shelving in a climate controlled, airtight environment with advanced fire safety and security protections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 2005, a dedicated team of Corbis editors and archivists has been undertaking the initial phases of the "Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative" leading up to the move of the collection.  This has involved changing the archive classification system to classify pictures by photographer rather than by theme to regularize royalties, promote the collection and make it accessible to the public via the digitalization of prints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, since the imagery within the Sygma collection is the property of each photographer, Corbis has been contacting the more than 10,000 contributors to offer them an archive agreement confirming that they wish to participate in the archiving and commercial development of their works.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, Corbis is collaborating closely with the photographers to bring the collection to life by searching, identifying and digitizing the most significant photos from the collection to be available via the Corbis website.  Since 2002, Corbis has digitized more than 55,000 pictures to bring the total number available online to 800,000 from the collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Sygma archive is comprised of nine separate collections of unique photos from the second half of the 20th century.  The 1950s and 1960s imagery includes photography from Apis, Universal Photo, Interpress, Spitzer, Reporter AssociÃ©s and other agencies.  The collections from the 1970s and beyond includes the prestigious photojournalism, news, magazines, celebrities and portraits from the Sygma photo agency, as well as television and movie set imagery from Kipa, and sporting events from Tempsport.

      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK  (September 28, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced it will be the exclusive image partner for the Morelia Film Festival in Morelia, Mexico on October 5-14, 2007.

    <EventDesc>Corbis Launches U.S. Election Microsite </EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>With Ever More Emphasis on Campaign Style and Appearance, Corbis Caters to Political Advertising Firms and News Media with Wide Selection of Politically-Related Imagery and Footage </i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE  (September 17, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced the launch of a new microsite at <a href="http://www.corbis.com/politics" target="_blank">www.corbis.com/politics</a> focused on meeting the image and footage needs of advertising agencies, campaigns and news media during the 2008 U.S. campaign. 
      </p>

      <p>
 Research predicts that political ad spending for the 2008 election cycle will set records by surpassing the $3 billion mark, an increase of more than 75 percent from the last Presidential election in 2004. In particular, online and newspaper ad spending are expected to increase significantly. 
      </p>

      <p>
The new Corbis politics page makes it fast and easy to search for and license election-related rights managed (RM) imagery and footage as well as highly-flexible, value priced, royalty-free (RF) imagery that can be bought once and used almost anywhere for any duration. The regularly updated website will provide advertisers and news media with highly-relevant image collections compiled with trends insight from Corbis' Creative Intelligence team. 
      </p>

	 <p>
To support ad and media professionals, the new microsite will match imagery and footage to breaking news and specific events such as national debates and primaries, profile "States to Watch" and highlight hot campaign issues with libraries of related imagery. There will also be simple navigation to photography and footage of national and party symbols, specific constituent groups as well as state flags, national monuments and other Americana. 
      </p>

      	 <p>
"Every year elections are more targeted and political consultants need to be able to quickly crank out fresh, demographically-specific communications," said Peter Moran, Chief Operating Officer at Winning Directions, a political direct mail firm and member of the American Association of Political Consultants. "Corbis has a great collection of political imagery that is simple and easy to use, and we rely on them not just for images, but as a creative partner to help us create the most effective direct-mail communications in the business and winning campaigns for our clients." 
      </p>

      <p>
According to analysis from Corbis' Creative Intelligence team, a significant trend for the 2008 campaign will be issue-based ads, as campaigns and interest groups try to engage voters on specific issues that they may care about such as global warming, healthcare and national security and sway them to candidates with a particular stance on these issues. This trend is being fueled by the recent Supreme Court decision to remove restrictions on so-called "issue ads" typically used by advocacy groups, labor unions, and corporations.
      </p>

      <p>
"Successful campaigns know that imagery truly can speak a thousand words about candidates and their view on the issues," said Steve Moss, Vice President, Sales &amp; Service for North America, Corbis. "It is essential that campaign establish a distinct visual signature to successfully break through the clutter and convey a message in today's cluttered media environment."

      </p>
      
      <p>
    The proprietary research is a result of an extensive review of thousands of top-selling Corbis images and commercial and editorial tear sheets coupled with analysis of the latest demographic and psychographic research. The reports help to inform the highly relevant, trend-driven imagery and footage from Corbis while providing creative insight for professionals.  
      </p>

      <p>
    The following <b>CREATIVE IQ Trends</b> reports are available for download in September at <a href="http://www.corbis.com/boutique" target="_blank">www.corbis.com/boutique</a>.<br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Global Greening:</b> The grassroots movement among environmentalists has blossomed into a worldwide mainstream interest in eco-friendly living. Global Greening is playing out in a host of specific concepts demanding relevant imagery including Karma Consumers, Green Glamour, Children of Nature, Eco Travelers, World Protectors and Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS), all demonstrating how green is in vogue and increasingly a matter of personal responsibility.<br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Generational Re-Connect:</b> As a result of demographic and social trends, the number of multigenerational families sharing the same household in the United States has grown by approximately 60 percent over the past 15 years, mirroring trends in Europe and Asia, where family has always played an important cultural role. Images of kids, parents and grandparents spending time together and sharing the same household are becoming increasingly relevant. <br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Millennial Development:</b> Around the world in emerging and developed countries, today's kids, known as "Millennials," are going to school in ever greater numbers. U.S. enrollment is up 10% since 1970, partly driven by immigration, and the UN has put a focus on achieving universal primary schooling by 2015 as part of its Millennium Development goals. Meanwhile, technology is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in today's school. As a result, imagery of modern, diverse and multi-cultural school environments is increasingly in demand.
      </p>

    <EventDesc>Corbis Takes Care of Buried Ad Creatives</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>New "I Am Buried" Integrated Marketing Campaign Finds Overworked Creatives and Rewards them with Self-Indulgent Prizes, Including Personal Assistant, Shopping Sprees, Dinner with Friends and Maid Service </i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK  (September 4, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced a new integrated marketing campaign, "I Am Buried," that empathizes with the plight of over-stretched creatives. The campaign's promotion helps alleviate the suffering of creatives' frenetic days and late nights at the office with self-indulgent prizes from a personal assistant or shopping spree to maid service or a massage to help make their lives "a little less horrible, one prize at a time." 
      </p>

      <p>
       The new integrated campaign launches today in the U.S. and Canada to point advertising creatives to the online destination <a href="http://www.iamburied.com" target="_blank">www.iamburied.com</a>.  On the web site, people can enter the "I Am Buried" contest by nominating themselves or colleagues by documenting their heartless horror stories, piled up desks, tear-stained faces or ruthless interactions with bosses and clients.  Entries can become creative multimedia projects by uploading personal photos or by searching the Corbis collection for images that represent how they are feeling and showing that they are the most buried ad creative, and therefore deserve an indulgent prize.
      </p>

      <p>
       The campaign was conceived by Creature, a full-service creative agency based in Seattle that is literally and figuratively immersed in the "I Am Buried" concept.  The promotion is supported by direct marketing, PR and print and interactive advertising, including online banners that highlight the promotion's prizes, with Corbis offering massage therapy, gourmet dinners or apartment cleaning to help take care of buried creatives.  
      </p>
      
	 <p>
     "We all work on internet time "" 24/7/365 "" which doesn't leave much time for anything else!" said Kate Nickerson, Vice President, Marketing, Corbis. "As a creative resource, Corbis helps advertisers bring great work to life with images and rights services. This campaign is a fun and novel way for us to demonstrate that our commitment goes one step further.  We want to help keep things light and make creatives' whole lives easier as well."
      </p>
      
      <p>
    The "I Am Buried" contest to find the most buried creatives will be judged by a panel of overworked experts in the U.S. and Canada, including:<br/>
"&#8226;	Rich Wallace, Creative Director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather in New York<br/>
"&#8226;	Todd Winter, Creative Director at IMC2 in Dallas<br/>
"&#8226;	Zach Canfield, Creative Recruiter/Manager at Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco<br/>
"&#8226;	MÃ©lanie Girard, Creative Director at Amalgame in Montreal<br/>
"&#8226;	Cleo Hayes, Brand Manager at Corbis in New York  
      </p>
      
      	 <p>
     "It's about time that somebody looked out for the under-appreciated and hard-working, late-night warriors," said Jim Haven, Creative Director and Principal, Creature. "We love this idea because it highlights that Corbis is behind the scenes helping to be a creative's best friend."
      </p>
      
      <p>
    The contest runs September 4th through September 30th and is subject to the Official Rules.  Each week, there will be one grand prize winner and five weekly winners for a total of 24 winners.  
      </p>
 
      <p>      
      Grand Prize winners may receive one of the following:<br/>
"&#8226;	Personal Staff "" An assistant to help make their life easer for a day.  It may be a personal driver to drive them around, a chef to make their favorite meals, or a personal assistant to run errands they haven't had time for.<br/>
"&#8226;	Dinner, Not In The Office "" A gift card for an all-expense paid dinner for 10 at a local restaurant may help.<br/>
"&#8226;	Party Bus "" A party bus for the creative and his/her friends to travel around the city in style for one night.<br/>
"&#8226;	Extreme Retail Therapy "" A gift card for a shopping expedition worth $1,750.
      </p>
      
      <p>        
      Weekly Prize winners may receive one of the following:<br/>
"&#8226;	Massage Therapy "" A gift card for a massage with a licensed massage therapist at a local spa.<br/>
"&#8226;	Maid Service "" A cleaning service will go to the winner's home and clean.<br/>
"&#8226;	Retail Therapy "" A gift card for shopping expedition worth $200.<br/>
"&#8226;	Late-Night Survival Kit "" If they are going to be working late, they might as well do it in style, such as a supply of gourmet snacks, bottled drinks, and more stuff to get them through the long nights.<br/>
"&#8226;	Get Your Own Personal Assistant "" For one day, a person will help the winner by running personal errands.

    <EventDesc>Corbis and European Pressphoto Agency (epa) Extend Distribution Partnership to France</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>After Strong Sales through Corbis in Other Markets since 2005 Agreement, epa to Begin Distribution via Corbis in France</i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>PERPIGNAN, France (September 3, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced an exclusive agreement with the European Pressphoto Agency (epa) to extend its extensive marketing, distribution and licensing partnership to France.  The announcement was made at the VISA POUR L'IMAGE 19th Annual International Festival of Photojournalism taking place September 1 to September 16, 2007 in Perpignan, France.
      </p>

      <p>
       The announcement builds upon the success of Corbis licensing epa imagery in many other markets throughout Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, an agreement that was first signed and announced in 2005.
      </p>

      <p>
      Under the agreement, Corbis will market in France epa's news-based photography to all magazine and book publishers, as well as advertising and marketing creative professionals. The editorial teams from both companies cooperate daily to ensure that the most relevant and vivid images are delivered for a diverse range of global audiences.
      </p>
      
	 <p>
     Philippe Bagot, Corbis Vice President of Sales for Europe, commented: "The French media industry is heavily demanding current events and news archive imagery. With one of the highest magazine readership in Europe, a particularly large selection of national news magazines and the increasing popularity of media websites, France is a critical market place for high-quality international news photography.  epa fulfils that need by covering news, entertainment and sports all over the world and will find an ideal distribution partner through Corbis' sales and web site in France."
      </p>
      
      <p>
    Since its initial partnership agreement with Corbis in 2005, epa has continued to expand in the global news photography market. Its outstanding imagery is regularly featured in front page coverage around the world. epa's worldwide network of 400 photographers continue to contribute to an average daily epa photo report of over 800 images.
      </p>
      
      	 <p>
     Sandra Boerma, Director International Sales at epa, added: "We originally chose to work with Corbis in many global markets because we felt Corbis' offering complemented our own. In the last two years we have been pleased with how the partnership has extended our brand around the world. The addition of this service in France, an important geographical market for us, is an important next step."

        <i>Company Puts Focus on Creating a Virtual Community Space for Art Enthusiasts While Showcasing Corbis and SnapVillage Collections as well as Rights Services Expertise</i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>SEATTLE  (August 29, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced that it has opened a gallery in Second Life that is focused on creating a community space where those interested in art and photography can view, share and discuss imagery.  
      </p>

      <p>
       Corbis' presence in Second Life will showcase imagery from the Corbis and SnapVillage microstock collections as well as provide information on Corbis' world-leading Rights Services expertise.  Corbis is also planning to help create a greater sense of community amongst photography enthusiasts in Second Life by hosting in-world social events, art shows and competitions where people can share their imagery with other residents. Image licensing will not be available at this time via Second Life.
      </p>

      <p>
       Stephen Gillett, Corbis' Vice President of Technology (Avatar Name: Corbis Kamachi), led the design and creation efforts for the Corbis gallery in Second Life. Gillett is a well-known and highly respected online MMORPG gamer and guild master. The gallery is located on an island in a sweeping glassed-in gallery space that has specific areas highlighting imagery from different Corbis collections, as well as Corbis Motion, Corbis Rights Services and SnapVillage, an innovative new user-generated microstock web site.
      </p>
      
       <p>
      "We didn't want this to be some big-bang corporate marketing activity, but instead are taking a grassroots approach by focusing on sharing great imagery for the SL community to enjoy," said Gillett. "We hope to make our gallery a social gathering place and a cultural landmark within Second Life and foster a lot of discussion about photography in this emerging medium." 
      </p>

      <p>
    Gallery visitors will be able to browse iconic images from Corbis' collection sourced from more than 100 million creative, entertainment and historical images, and the galleries will be updated regularly with fresh pieces.

      </p>

      <p>
       The behind-the-scenes imagery and video, including exclusive celebrity candids and interviews with actors and filmmakers by Moving Pictures Magazine editors, will be shot in the special OutlineLive mobile studio at the event.  Moving Pictures Magazine will feature the imagery in its comprehensive editorial coverage of the event in its Maggie Award-winning publication as well as on its online destination, www.MovingPicturesMagazine.com.
      </p>

      <p>
       "Our industry is changing at breathtaking speed, and it's all about innovation and anticipating the celebrity imagery needs of our clients," said Beate Chelette, Senior Director of Photography, Entertainment, Corbis.

      </p>
      
            <p>

Moving Pictures Magazine is based in Santa Monica, California.  
      </p>

     "Corbis's quality photography, reputation and aesthetically attractive approach to the entertainment industry made collaboration a perfect fit for us," said Elliot V.

    <EventDesc>Corbis Helps Find Fame for Broadcast Advertisers </EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Bounty, GE and BC Hydro Turn to Corbis for VIP Access to Film Clips, Famous Figures and Hard-to-find Footage to bring their TV Ad Campaigns to Life </i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>NEW YORK  (August 15, 2007)  - </b>Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), a creative resource for advertising, marketing and media professionals, today announced its work with major brands including Bounty, GE and BC Hydro to help them quickly and easily find, license and handle personality clearances for footage and film clips that were integral to television commercials in North America and Europe.  The TV campaigns were created by leading advertising agencies including Publicis, BBDO New York and DDB Canada with help from Corbis Rights &amp; Music Clearances.
      </p>

      <p>
       Publicis called on Corbis to help produce a Bounty TV commercial currently airing in the UK and Ireland. The commercial features two recurring Bounty characters that were edited into a scene of the 1970 hit British romantic comedy "Carry on Loving."  In the commercial, characters use Bounty paper towels to clean up the mess created by the food fight at the wedding.  Corbis licensed clips from the film and handled personality clearances for actors Sid James, Hattie Jacques and Kenneth Williams through their respective estates. 
      </p>

      <p>
       "We were very impressed with the service that Corbis provided us," said Clare Young, Producer, Publicis. "The whole process ran very smoothly, and we would not hesitate in using Corbis again for any future projects."
      </p>
      
            <p>
       BBDO New York recently enlisted Corbis to help source HD footage of animals of the Serengeti for an in-cinema and online campaign for GE called "Serengeti."  The spot highlights GE's ecomagination campaign and features a casting call for the movie "Evan Almighty," using real animals like a baboon and an elephant taking direction from the movie crew.
      </p>

      <p>
      "Our team had a great idea for our client, but we needed footage of Serengeti animals to bring this idea to life quickly," said Regina Ebel, Head of Broadcast Production, BBDO New York. "We chose to work with Corbis because we know they have great relationships and resources, and they were able to research and supply the footage mastered to HD."
      </p>
      
      <p>
      DDB Canada turned to Corbis for help on a TV and online campaign for BC Hydro, one of the largest electric utilities in Canada. The idea for the spot, called the "Power of One," was to feature how famous Canadians including astronaut Marc Garneau, Academy-Award nominated actor Chief Dan George, paraplegic athlete and activist Rick Hansen and NHL Hockey Coach Roger Neilson started something small and ended up doing something big. The commercial illustrates that with individual small energy saving steps, BC Hydro customers can achieve big combined savings in electricity use. Corbis researched and negotiated the appropriate famous personalities and obtained rights clearances while simultaneously sourcing footage. 
      </p>
      
       <p>
      "Corbis helped elevate our ad to a whole new level by helping to find and secure just the right people to communicate our message," said  Lynn Bonham, Broadcast Producer, DDB Canada. "Since they handle more than 5,000 clearances a year, we knew they'd be the right partner as BC Hydro tries to start a social movement towards energy efficiency."
      </p>
      
        <p>
      "We want to help take the pressure off so Creatives can focus on great ideas and brilliant results," said Curtis Bowden, Vice President, Rights Services, Corbis. "With our deep relationships in Hollywood and with content owners around the world, we know how much licensing rights should cost and can advise clients on what is most likely to clear within the desired timeframe and budget so they can be confident that their great ideas will come to life."
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Corbis has the world's leading Rights &amp; Music Clearances offering with experienced, dedicated global teams of specialists handling licensing of content and related personality clearances.  Corbis has unprecedented relationships with third-party rights holders""including major studios, record companies, celebrities, estates and publishers""enabling it to help clients license almost any content and handle all clearances for use. Corbis helps commercial producers find and license almost any content they need including music, TV and film clips, as well as footage from its leading Corbis Motion collection and libraries worldwide.

      <p>
        <i> Innovative Beta Website Empowered by Corbis Combines Best Features of Consumer Photo-sharing Sites with an Online Marketplace To Create a Distinctly Better Place to Buy and Sell Affordable Photography</i>
      </p>
      
            <p><b>Highlights Include:</b><br/>
"&#8226;	Innovative "Pick Your Own Price" Model Gives Photographers Flexibility and Control by Letting them Price Imagery at Price Points from $1 to $50 with No Exclusivity Requirements<br/>
"&#8226;	SnapVillage to act as Photographer Farm Club for Corbis, Giving Top Photographers the Chance to Move to a Premium Website<br/>
"&#8226;	Smart, Simple, Fresh Interface as well as Straight-forward Pricing and Purchasing Makes Website User-Friendly for Buyers <br/>
"&#8226;	Rich Interactivity Features and Proprietary "˜Snappyness' Rating Make Finding Great Imagery Easy and Fun by Leveraging Community to Identify the Best Pictures<br/>
</p>
      
      
      <p>

        <b>SEATTLE  (June 25, 2007)  - </b>SnapVillage, empowered by Corbis, today announced the beta opening of a fresh, interactive and innovative online marketplace for user-generated photography at  <a href="http://www.snapvillage.com" target="_blank">www.snapvillage.com</a>. The new website has no membership fees and is now accepting submissions from photographers anywhere in the world and offering image licensing in the United States.</p>

      <p>Built from the ground-up after an extensive review and analysis of existing microstock sites and the rapidly evolving Web 2.0 and user-generated environments, the beta opening of SnapVillage introduces innovative advances in the submission, pricing, searching and purchasing of royalty-free (RF) photography that can be bought once and used almost anywhere for any duration. </p>

	 <p>"SnapVillage is a major step forward for microstock with fresh, thoughtfully designed innovations that simplify and improve the experience of licensing low-cost, user-generated, royalty-free photography via the Internet," said Gary Shenk, incoming Chief Executive Officer, Corbis. "We're excited about also using SnapVillage as a farm club to find great photographers who can sell their photographs on Corbis." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Aside from providing contact and PayPal information, the website does not require any application or approval processes for photographers or any pre-pay obligations of buyers.  While in beta, SnapVillage will be actively listening and incorporating customer feedback and introducing enhancements to the website on a continuous basis over the coming months.</p>


<p>
<b>Picture Perfect Advancements Help Photographers Maximize Their Income</b><br/>
SnapVillage introduces a revolutionary pricing model that gives pricing flexibility and control to photographers across a broader range of prices than other microstock websites, as well as streamlined submission and the opportunity for their photography to be upgraded to Corbis.<br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Pricing That Empowers Photographers:</b> SnapVillage's unique pricing structure gives photographers greater control and flexibility in managing and maximizing their photography and income. The SnapVillage "˜Pick Your Own Price' model gives photographers the ability to set image price levels at five increments of $1, $5, $10, $25 and $50.  Photographers are able to change prices on their pictures at any time. SnapVillage does not have any type of exclusivity agreements and pays a royalty rate of 30 percent across the board for all flat price image sales, and 30 cents a download on all subscriptions sales. All photographer payments are made via PayPal. <br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Access to the Premium Market:</b> As part of the Corbis network, SnapVillage can offer its contributors something most other microstock sites can't: potential access to the premium stock photography market. SnapVillage will act as a "˜farm club' as Corbis editors will be scouting SnapVillage to find great photographers who show the potential to sell their work on Corbis. <br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Streamlined Image Submission:</b> SnapVillage's open submission process invites anyone worldwide, from the hobbyist to the professional photographer, to submit images to SnapVillage's website. Images will be processed by the SnapVillage editorial team who will review the imagery before releasing them to the SnapVillage website. Images may be uploaded directly through the Internet or by mailing a DVD to SnapVillage (address available at SnapVillage.com).
 </p>

      <p>
<b>SnapVillage Defines Simplicity for Creative People Looking for Affordable, Flexible Photography</b><br/>
SnapVillage is designed to be simple enough for anyone to use, from the seasoned design professional to the novice school newsletter editor. SnapVillage has an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, simple pricing and payment and rich user-interactivity that leverages the community to identify the freshest imagery. <br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Straightforward Pricing and Payment:</b>   SnapVillage makes purchasing images simple and easy. Photographs can either be licensed individually or via a subscription.  Individual images are available at $1, $5, $10, $25 and $50, and there is the same flat price for all file sizes {Small (~3mb), Medium (~6-8mb) and Large (more than 10mb)}. In addition, SnapVillage offers a subscription at a cost of $199 for 30 days with a maximum of 750 downloads. All payments are conducted via credit card without cumbersome credit packs, tokens or other complicated pricing schemes that require buyers to make upfront commitments.  A small selection of free content will always be available on SnapVillage to allow users to experiment with the website.<br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Simple, Superior Customer Experience: </b> SnapVillage has a simple, clean, professional website that is designed to be more interesting and easier to use.  SnapVillage has put an emphasis on making the website intuitive for all types of creative buyers, so that people with all levels of experience will feel comfortable using it. <br/>
"&#8226;	<b>Snappyness Score Uncovers Fun, Fresh Imagery: </b> SnapVillage offers fun and useful interactivity features such as community image tagging, saving pictures as favorites, commenting on images and sharing images with others that allow users to communicate with each other and with the website in multiple ways, thereby enhancing the experience of the entire community. Every image in the SnapVillage catalog has a living, breathing "Snappyness" score based on a sophisticated and proprietary algorithm.  "Snappyness" is a dynamic rating that is driven by multiple measures of a picture's popularity, including the number of times it has been viewed, downloaded, favorited, commented upon, shared and purchased. The Snappyness rating ensures that SnapVillage searches yield the freshest, best images.
 </p>
      

      <p>
      "With SnapVillage, we are trying to break out of the mold of the existing microstock websites," said Adam Brotman, Vice President, Networks, Corbis, who has overseen the creation of SnapVillage.   "We are combining the best features of consumer photo-sharing sites with an innovative online marketplace approach and the stock agency expertise of Corbis to create a distinctly better place to buy and sell affordable photography. SnapVillage is a fresh microstock marketplace that we hope will be attractive to photographers while at the same time providing a friendly, professional way for creative people to find the right photography to get the job done."

    <EventDesc>Corbis Shares Latest Visual and Cultural Trends Behind Creative Imagery </EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Gender Roles Are Being Redefined Globally, While North America Is Focused on Family, Europe on Getting Out of the Office for Work or Play, and Asia on the 2008 Olympics</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>Cannes, France (June 20, 2007)  - </b>Corbis today announced the latest emerging visual and cultural trends in imagery identified by its global Creative Intelligence team. The research and analysis is released on a quarterly basis to help anticipate the emerging imagery needs of creatives and guide photographers toward capturing images that are likely to be in high demand by advertising and marketing professionals around the world. The announcement was made during the Cannes International Advertising Festival taking place June 17 to June 23 in Cannes, France. </p>

      <p>The Corbis Creative Intelligence team supports both photographers and customers in their creative endeavors by anticipating future market shifts. The team works with local art directors to develop imagery that best reflects today's cultural and stylistic trends and that resonates strongly with target markets both regionally and globally. </p>

      <p>"Photographers love receiving trend information that will help set their work apart, while creatives find relevant imagery that supports their vision," said Amber Calo, Senior Manager, Creative Intelligence at Corbis. "By analyzing consumer trends and insights, we're walking in the same shoes as account planners at ad agencies. We ask the same questions and strive to deliver imagery that will resonate with their target markets."</p>
      
      <p>All of the following trends are relevant globally, but some are currently more pronounced in specific regions, and so are listed geographically.</p>
      
      <p>
      <b>Global Trends: Changing Gender Roles and Medical Tourism</b><br/>      
      "&#8226;	<b>Rise of Female Entrepreneurs:</b> Women around the world are entering the workforce in record numbers, with many starting their own home-based businesses. As a result, men are taking a more active role in childrearing and domestic duties. Images of stay-at-home dads, mothers in business settings, and women multitasking at home represent this trend.<br/>      
      "&#8226;	<b>Medical Miles:</b> Due to rising medical costs and overburdened healthcare systems, particularly in the US, UK, and Canada, many people are traveling overseas, especially to India, for high quality, less expensive medical procedures. Due to lower costs, some even use the opportunity to do some sight-seeing while they recuperate. Images that support this trend feature doctors and patients interacting, hi-tech medical facilities, and mature tourists around the world. <br/>   
      </p>
      
      
            <p>
     <b>North American Trends: Stronger Family Ties and Booming Schools</b><br/>      
     "&#8226;	<b>Generational Re-Connect:</b> The number of multigenerational families living together in the US has grown by 60 percent over the past 15 years. As more Baby Boomers reach retirement age, many are taking a more active role in their grandchildren's lives. This trend is supported by images of grandparents providing child care, family vacations, and group photos with three or more generations represented. <br/>      
     "&#8226;	<b>Millennial Development:</b> Driven by increased births during the late 1980s and a rise in immigration, a record-high 55 million children are projected to be enrolled in American schools by the fall of 2007. Minorities now make up 40 percent of elementary and high school students, compared with 21 percent in 1970. Imagery showcasing this trend includes diversity in schools, students interacting with teachers, and students using technology. <br/>      
      </p>
      
                  <p>
    <b>European Trends: The Flexible Office and City Tourism</b><br/>      
   "&#8226;	<b>Out of Office:</b> The very definition of "office" has changed. Considerably more people are using non-traditional spaces such as cafes, bookstores, parks, and their homes to conduct their business, allowing greater flexibility and the opportunity to spend more time with family. Images of casual business meetings, working parents, and people working in coffee shops support this trend.<br/>        
   "&#8226;	<b>Pocket Vacations:</b> City tourism has grown significantly in recent years, with people taking shorter trips closer to home rather than more traditional longer vacations to far-flung locales. Many of these vacations are to big cities across Europe and focus on sight-seeing and visits to famous cultural attractions. Images of families at tourist attractions, sight-seeing, and taking local transportation illustrate this trend.<br/>      
      </p>
      
                        <p>
    <b>Asia-Pacific Trends: Olympic Games and the Mainstream Goes Mobile</b><br/>      
   "&#8226;	<b>Global Arena:</b> The 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing are expected to draw one million visitors from other parts of China and another half-million foreign tourists. To prepare for the Games and the influx of tourists, China is spending $30 billion to build stadiums and hotels and improve infrastructure such as transportation and telecommunications. Relevant images include shots of Olympic Sports and Olympic traditions, and Chinese landmarks and updated tourist attractions. <br/>      
   "&#8226;	<b>Wi-Community: </b>Wireless technology, particularly mobile devices, is swiftly changing both work and social life across Asia. One of the fastest growing contributors to this industry is the mobile market, with China representing the world's largest market with over 431 million mobile users. This trend is reinforced by images of people of all ages using technology, businesspeople using wireless technology, and people traveling with technology.<br/>

        <i>Customer Base Soars by More than 50% as Companies and Ad Agencies Including American Greetings, Malibu-Kahlua International, ASPCA and AvreaFoster Turn to Corbis to Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness of Advertising and Marketing Operations</i>
      </p>
      <p>

The announcement was made at the Henry Stewart DAM symposium in New York, NY.</p>

      <p>The strong customer growth and continued satisfaction for deployments of Corbis Media Management reinforces the solution's selection as the Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Digital Media Application in 2006.  Corbis Media Management helps streamline marketing operations to lower costs, shorten production times and enhance impact by centralizing, organizing and managing digital media assets.</p>

      <p>"Corbis Media Management is ideal for helping us better manage the various brand marketing campaigns we do," said Sandrine Ricard, Vice President, Communications, Malibu-Kahlua International. "We're able to locate and use content right away, get work out the door faster and make sure our brand is represented consistently on a global basis. It lets us focus on the creativity of our campaigns, without spending time on facilitating requests for photography or graphics by our internal staff or our creative partners."</p>

The hosted platform is a proven, highly scalable marketing solution that improves workflow and helps maximize the efficiency of any company's marketing team by freeing them up to be marketers, not distributors of company assets.</p>
      
      <p>AvreaFoster, a Dallas-based advertising agency, needed to deploy a Media Management platform for their clients and found that Corbis was the best choice. With a breadth of features, great flexibility and reasonable cost, Corbis was the obvious choice for a solution. The agency has chosen to partner with Corbis Media Management in order to offer the solution to clients as part of its branding services.</p>
      
      <p>"The Corbis Media Management solution allows us to offer our clients a more complete package of services that gives us a competitive differentiator in the market place," said Dave Foster, President and CEO, AvreaFoster.</p>

Corbis Media Management has helped Intergraph create a more efficient marketing environment by providing the company with a hosted, online solution for its digital assets, thus eliminating the issues associated with installing and maintaining a software application for all of their offices.</p>

      <p>"We considered several solutions that would enable us to share our logos and images among our global offices," said Sarah Durling, art director, Intergraph.  "We selected Corbis Media Management because they offered a solution that was efficient and helped us save on resources." </p>

      <p>As a secure, web-accessible solution, the Corbis Media Management platform enables customers to avoid the hassle and expense of software and hardware installation and system maintenance, while giving users the flexibility to expand the service as their needs evolve. Corbis employs daily system backups, robust security, and a 99.5 percent uptime guarantee that its clients' assets will always be accessible.</p>

      <p>"These forward-thinking organizations are turning to innovative solutions that enable them to better manage their media assets, streamline the creative workflow and expedite the brand approval process," said Jon Schupp, Vice President, Media Management Services, Corbis.  "They also have a leg up on the competition by staying in control of their brand voice while being able to localize ad and marketing materials quickly and easily as needed."</p>

    <EventDesc>Corbis Unveils Packed Schedule at Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival
</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Commitment to Cannes Reinforces Corbis' Position as Leading Creative Resource for the Advertising Industry as Company Focuses on Best Pictures, Period </i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>SEATTLE (June 5, 2007)  - </b>Corbis today announced a packed sponsorship and activity schedule for the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival 2007, showcasing the company's commitment to providing the advertising community with leading creative resources including imagery, footage and Rights Services.
      </p>

      <p>"It's important to help recognize the creative talent and tremendous work over the past year, which has really seen some standout advertising from agencies around the world," said Gary Shenk, incoming CEO, Corbis. "We are here to celebrate great work as a partner that helps creatives, from start to finish, bring their ideas to life with the best pictures, footage and Rights Services."</p>

      <p>Corbis is celebrating its third consecutive year as the exclusive entertainment sponsor for the Festival.  Corbis will host both the Opening and Closing Gala events, two of the most prestigious international advertising events held each year.</p>

      <p>Additionally, demonstrating its commitment to nurturing the next generation of greats, Corbis is sponsoring the Roger Hatchuel Academy.  Tristan Eaton, artist and the curator of the Thunderdog Collective, a project supported by Corbis engaging artists from the worlds of street art, graphic design, illustration, urban vinyl and designer toys to create new works to be licensed exclusively through Corbis, will be one of the key speakers at the Academy, along with Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. </p>
    
      <p>Following the resounding success in 2006, Corbis is once again placing its "˜Corbis Creativity CafÃ©' at the heart of its activities in Cannes.  Located at the Majestic Hotel, across from the Palais des Festivals, the stunning space will be the ideal location for Lions visitors to pick up a smoothie to revive flagging spirits, send emails back to the office or simply relax and nurse a hangover.</p>
     
     <p>Building on the entertainment theme, a stunning Corbis Outline exhibition celebrating the celebrity portraiture of Denis Rouvre, a Corbis Outline photographer, will be showcased throughout Cannes during the Festival. Entitled "Cannes fait le mur" the exhibition is designed to highlight the bond between the city of Cannes and globally acclaimed actors, with more than 15 giant billboards and posters of international celebrities displayed throughout the city until July 15th.  Elijah Wood, Alain Delon, Kevin Bacon, Samuel L.Jackson, Diane Kruger, Rosy de Palma, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks et Maiwenn will be displayed on the rue d'Antibes, and Emma de Caunes, Vincent Cassel, Gaspard Ulliel, Morgan Freeman, Jean Dujardin et Marion Cotillard will be seen throughout other parts of the city.</p>
     
     <p>Corbis is also hosting an exclusive, invite-only evening event for clients in partnership with SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT and Creativity magazine at the Majestic on Thursday 21st June with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter John Legend performing live.</p>
     
    <p>Corbis will also award the winner of "Da Leone", its competition for Italian advertising agency creatives designed to showcase creative talent and the quality of Corbis imagery.  In February 2007, Corbis set a brief challenging the agencies to devise a press campaign using only Corbis shots to promote a fictional hair care product "˜forfocolor'.  With the unique prize of an exclusive area on the "˜Corbis Creative Boat' and accommodation at next year's event, the lucky winning team will certainly be eagerly anticipating Cannes Lions 2007.</p>

    <EventDesc>New Solo Exhibition Celebrates Photography of the Late Fernando Bengoechea </EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>Corbis Donates Print To Permanent Collection At The International Festival-Institute At Round Top From Famed Photographer Fernando Bengoechea Who Tragically Vanished In The Asian Tsunami</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>SEATTLE and ROUND TOP, Texas (May 23, 2007)  - </b>The International Festival-Institute at Round Top and Corbis today announced a new solo exhibition of internationally-renowned photographer Fernando Bengoechea, whose work has been widely published throughout the world. The exhibition is at the concert hall at Festival Hill at the non-profit International Festival-Institute at Round Top in historic Round Top, Texas from June 9 to December 31, 2007 and features 46 photographs and one woven piece. 
      </p>

      <p>This will be the first major showing of Bengoechea's work since he disappeared in the Asian tsunami of 2004, and the first devoted entirely to his photography rather than his fine art. The exhibition, curated by Lamar Lentz, represents the breadth of his career including interiors, architecture, landscape, fashion and celebrity portraits. </p>

      <p>"We are honored to exhibit Fernando's work in Round Top," said James Dick, Founder and world renowned Pianist from the International Festival-Institute at Round Top. "We are humbled and grateful that the Estate has recognized the uniqueness and dedication to the arts of our organization and allowed us to honor his legacy and open it to new audiences."</p>
     
      <p>Senior Director of Entertainment Photography for Corbis, Beate Chelette, has together with Corbis donated a limited edition print of Bengoechea's, "Blue Piano," to the Institute's permanent collection. Prior to his passing, Bengoechea was one of the leading photographers of celebrity at-home and interior imagery for BeateWorks, acquired in 2006 by Corbis, which now exclusively represents his photography worldwide. </p>

      <p>"Fernando has touched so many with his spirited and beautiful images of design, living and people," said Chelette. "Seeing the exhibit today, I feel for the first time at peace as his power and strength is captured and recognized for eternity.  I sincerely hope that this exhibition will travel the world."</p>
      
      <p>"Seeing the images in this unique and powerful show only reiterates the importance and power of his work," said Nate Berkus, Fernando's partner and survivor of the Tsunami, who is an acclaimed interior designer and a regular guest on "The Oprah Winfrey Show," where he offers design advice to viewers. </p>
      
      <p>"Speaking for my entire family, we are so pleased that Fernando is being honored in this way," said Marcelo Bengoechea, Fernando's brother who now oversees the Estate and has worked with Chelette and Corbis for two years to ensure that the integrity of his brother's work is preserved. "Fernando treated his craft the same way as he did his loved ones "" with dedication, intuition and tact. He made the subject comfortable and allowed them to tell their own story. His legacy is his life and how he touched people, all over the world, from royalty to homeless, personally or through his photos." </p>
      
      <p>Born in Argentina in 1965, Bengoechea spent part of his youth in Brazil before relocating to New York City in 1988 to pursue his art education, studying at the International Center of Photography, the School of Visual Arts, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and NYU. His work was widely published in such well-known magazines as Town and Country, Elle DÃ©cor, Vanity Fair, House and Garden, House Beautiful, Harper's Bazaar, Flair, In Style, Vogue, and O, The Oprah Magazine. He has previously been exhibited in Milan, New York City, Chicago, and Paris. </p>

      <p>The Festival-Institute is located about 70 miles from Austin and 100 miles from Houston in the Texas Hill Country on a 210-acre campus that includes music performance facilities, museums, historic houses, and gardens. The centerpiece of the campus is the magnificent 1,075-seat Festival Concert Hall. An exhibition space within the Concert Hall will be inaugurated with Bengoechea's photography exhibition.

    <EventDesc>Corbis Reinvents Accessibility to Celebrity Photography with Launch of OutlineLive</EventDesc>
    <EventText>
      <p>
        <i>New Collection Features High-Quality Candid Celebrity Portraiture That Can Be Quickly Priced and Licensed Online and Used For Any Editorial Purpose Without Publicist Restrictions</i>
      </p>
      <p>

        <b>SEATTLE (May 8, 2007)  - </b>Corbis today announced the launch of OutlineLive, a contemporary and fresh collection of celebrity photography featuring high-quality, candid celebrity portraiture that is faster and easier to license and is accessible for any editorial use, including online.  The innovative offering launches worldwide today and will feature more than 35,000 images from the world's leading celebrity photographers by the end of the month.
      </p>

      <p>The demand for celebrity and entertainment imagery continues to soar.  Entertainment and celebrity pages in magazines have grown by about 15 percent annually since 2001, and celebrity images now represent nearly half of all magazine covers. The top five celebrity magazines in the United States now sell a combined five million copies on newsstands each week. </p>

      <p>As a result of this growth, publishers are demanding accessible and flexible high-end celebrity portraiture.  The new OutlineLive collection is the first offering on the market to meet this need by making unique, quality celebrity portraits available and accessible for all editorial uses. OutlineLive has no publicist restrictions, can be priced and licensed immediately on Corbis.com and can be published anywhere, including on the Internet.</p>

      <p>"As the spotlight on celebrity has become ever brighter in recent years, getting access to unique quality celebrity photos grows ever more important," said Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief, Total Film and Sky Movies, two of the leading publications in the U.K., with a combined readership in excess of 4 million.  "Corbis already provides us with a lot of excellent photography, and OutlineLive should provide a fresh additional approach for illustrating our editorial coverage." </p>

      <p>Corbis has taken a novel approach to the celebrity photography in OutlineLive, creating a collection of informal celebrity portraiture taken in controlled shoots that capture emotive, intimate and playfully spontaneous moments in relevant settings.  The collection includes fresh images from events as recent as the Tribeca Film Festival and the Coachella Music Festival in California. </p>

      <p>OutlineLive's collection will continue to grow with fresh photography taken onsite at exclusive events such as film and music festivals and in other casual settings around the world as well as through the addition of content from world-leading photographers.</p>

      <p>
        "OutlineLive creates an entirely new and innovative middle market offering that is higher in quality than red carpet shots and easier to access than our exclusive flagship Outline celebrity portraiture," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis. "OutlineLive is a quality, less restrictive, price-conscious collection that provides our clients with natural, revealing and unexpected celebrity imagery that they can use to enhance their covers, feature stories and online editions."
      </p>

      <p>OutlineLive is the latest addition to Corbis' inspired Personalities portfolio, with its market-leading Outline, Outline@Home and red-carpet Entertainment collections. </p>
      <p>
        Corbis Outline continues to feature originality and glamour at its best. Outline is the leader in the highest quality in-studio celebrity portraiture the world has to offer from the world's best photographers. This collection offers iconic images that exude style, imagination and prestige and have highly-exclusive usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outline@Home is a look at living well and the homes and lifestyles of the rich and famous. This collection includes exclusive, high quality photos that capture cutting edge design and style, and the work of the most renowned architects, designers and interior designers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corbis Entertainment offers timely, relevant images from select entertainment and fashion events worldwide including celebrities on the red carpet, award ceremonies, movie premieres, fashion show catwalks and parties.  It includes coverage by Corbis photographers plus media partners including Reuters and epa.

		<EventDesc>Corbis Helps Hallmark Turn Up The Volume On Sound Cards</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Hallmark Chooses Corbis to Help Acquire Music and Entertainment Content </i>
			</p>
			<p>
			
				<b>SEATTLE (May 2, 2007)  - </b>Corbis announced today it is working with Hallmark Cards, Inc. to continue to make the company's new product development efforts a reality. 
				</p>
				
			<p>
		    Corbis has been working closely with Hallmark to handle the talent rights acquisition and music clearances for Hallmark's line of sound cards which feature CD-quality recordings of original music and sound clips by the original artists and actors who recorded them.</p>
		    
		    <p>
		    The collection now features more than 250 cards and more than 100 original music artists including Willie Nelson, the Rolling Stones, Tim McGraw, Smash Mouth and Wang Chung, as well as dialogue and theme songs from popular movies and TV shows such as "Napoleon Dynamite," "I Love Lucy" and "Happy Days."  </p>

		    <p>
		    "Corbis is a perfect fit for this job," said Teddi Hernandez, licensing director for Hallmark.  "They understand our creative vision and have the Hollywood and global entertainment industry connections, as well as rights and music clearance experience to deliver the content. Corbis helps us navigate unfamiliar waters, avoid roadblocks and unnecessary risks."</p>
		    
		    <p>
		    Hallmark approached Corbis with their creative idea soon after the "Say It With Music" collection of cards was launched. This was followed by the expansion of sound cards to movies and popular television shows. Record labels, as well as movie studios and media companies, were eager to participate as they recognized the opportunity for new revenue.</p>
		    
		    <p>
		    "Hallmark has had foresight in recognizing that they could harness digital music and movie and TV clips to drive new product innovation," said David Reeder, Vice President, Branded Content Solutions, Corbis.  "We have been negotiating with dozens of content providers to license content that resonates with Hallmark's customers and are managing the complex process of getting the associated talent rights and music clearances." </p>
		    
		    <p>
		   Corbis also helped support the advertising campaign for the new line of cards, clearing personality, imagery, video footage and music rights for print advertisements, direct mail, TV commercials and online promotional use.</p>

			
			<p>The Hallmark cards cover a range of sending situations including birthday, thinking of you, friendship, love, anniversary, encouragement, support, new baby, congratulations and cope as well as popular holidays. The sound clips featured in the cards have multigenerational appeal.  The high sound quality from the cards' internal speaker is designed to be played again and again. The cards are priced at $4.99 each. </p>

		<EventDesc>New Corbis Broadcast Solutions Help Make Commercial Production Faster and Easier </EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Offerings establish Corbis as a creative partner for finding and licensing almost any content including music, TV, film clips and footage</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (April 18, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced its highly-anticipated Corbis Broadcast Solutions, a comprehensive set of offerings that establish the company as a creative partner for finding and licensing almost any existing content including music, TV and film clips as well as footage and photography.  Corbis also announced an expanded team of specialists to serve the broadcast market and further enrich its Corbis Motion collection. </p>
			<p>From strategy to conception, Corbis Broadcast Solutions are already enabling industry professionals at advertising agencies including TBWA/Chiat/Day in Los Angeles, JWT in Singapore and Modernista! in Boston to focus on their creative vision, not the logistics of how to get there.</p>
			<p>"We're here to help take the pressure off so Creatives can focus on great ideas and brilliant work," said Curtis Bowden, Vice President, Rights Services, Corbis. "We have deep relationships in Hollywood and with content owners around the world. We know how much licensing rights should cost and can advise clients on what is most likely to clear within the desired timeframe and budget so they can be confident that their great ideas will come to life." </p>
			<p>The Corbis Broadcast Solutions include:</p>
			
			<p>"&#8226;	<b>Rights &amp;  Music Clearances: </b>Corbis' highly-connected, global licensing teams are tough, savvy negotiators who conduct more than 5,000 clearances every year and can secure almost any third-party rights to celebrity talent, music, TV and film clips, trademarks, footage and more. Unlike most companies, Corbis indemnifies its clients by standing behind its licensing agreements.</p>
			<p>"&#8226;	<b>Corbis Motion &amp; Global Search: </b>Corbis' veteran Global Search specialists are the ultimate footage researchers, assisting broadcast producers in finding the perfect shots for their advertising campaigns by searching Corbis Motion's more than 25,000 clips as well as hundreds of partner footage libraries worldwide including nearly any television, movie and news collections.</p>
			<p>"&#8226;	<b>Photography &amp;  Fine Art:  </b>Corbis has a preeminent collection of more than 100 million creative, editorial and entertainment images for use in broadcast commercials and movies.</p>

			<p>Several clients are already benefiting from the Corbis Broadcast Solutions.  Corbis recently helped Modernista! by clearing publicity rights for several of the artists represented in U2's "Window in the Skies" music video, a montage that features about 100 archival clips of various musicians performing in concert.  In the video, the footage has been carefully edited so that the performances sync up with U2's lyrics and music.  </p>
			<p>"Corbis was instrumental in handling publicity rights clearances for several of the artists represented in U2's video," said Jeff Estow, Director of Business Affairs, Modernista! "Without our close partnership with Corbis, the video would have been impossible to produce on schedule."</p>
			<p>Corbis has also been working over the past several months with TBWA/Chiat/Day in L.A.  providing Corbis Motion and footage we acquired through Global Search from several suppliers in the U.S. and Europe for the innovative interactive campaign promoting Sony Computer Entertainment's PLAYSTATION(R)3 in North America.  The online campaign (www.playbeyond.com) visually demonstrates how SonyPlayStation3 is smarter, has greater capacity and higher definition than its competitors. </p>
			<p>JWT in Singapore called on Corbis to help with licensing content for a campaign for Unilever's Lipton tea brand that ran in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, China, Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The television commercial started airing on January 1, 2007. Corbis helped JWT license the publishing rights of the song "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach, for a commercial entitled "Rainbows" to highlight how Lipton tea can alter your mood and turn a bad day into a good one.</p>
			<p>"We approached Corbis because of their established, trusted reputation and global resources," said Daphne Ng, Producer, JWT Singapore.  "Working with Corbis ensured that we were able to secure all the third party rights we needed in the timeframe we needed them. They were a true creative partner and delivered flawlessly without skipping a beat."  </p>
		   <p>Corbis has expanded its Broadcast Solutions team with several new high profile additions in North America, Europe and Asia.

		<EventDesc>Corbis and ADC Announce Winners of Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award and Scholarship</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>The Walker Agency in Switzerland Recognized for Amnesty International Campaign and Jeanne Lee Awarded Scholarship for Trees New York Project</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>New York (April 16, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced the winners of the 2007 Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award in the professional and student categories. The Walker Agency won the award for its work on an Amnesty International campaign "" "It's Not Happening Here. But it is Happening." Student scholarship winner, Jeanne Lee, was recognized for her creation of the "Plant a Seed for a Greener Apple" school project for Trees New York.  </p>
			<p>The Social Justice award is part of Corbis' global signature community relations program, awarded through a special partnership with the Art Directors Club (ADC). The awards will be presented by Corbis CEO Steve Davis at the ADC 86th Annual Awards Gala on May 31, 2007. Amnesty International will receive $20,000 as the subject of the winning Walker campaign, and student, Jeanne Lee will receive a $5,000 scholarship for her winning campaign.</p>
			<p>"At Corbis we know that great creative work can have a really positive effect on the world, which is something we want to be recognized," said Steve Davis, CEO, Corbis. "The ADC shares our interest in promoting social justice, and our partnership with them allows us to reward the most talented and socially conscious group of creatives worldwide in an effort to promote social justice."</p>
			<p>The Walker Agency team created a campaign for Amnesty International entitled "It's Not Happening Here. But it is Happening Now." With a limited budget to create only 200 posters Walker set out to raise awareness of the atrocities and inhumane treatment taking place all over the world. The logistics and timing were crucial in this campaign, and the results far surpassed expectations. The campaign designed for Switzerland soon became known around the world, driving traffic to the Amnesty International website and increasing awareness. 
			</p>
            <p>"This award is an honor because it truly helps people and supports a good cause," said Pius Walker, Creative Director, The Walker Agency. "Most awards send you home with a statue to display in your office, but with this award Corbis is raising awareness and making a difference by awarding Amnesty International as well as the agency."</p>
			<p>Jeanne Lee, a student at the Pratt Institute, created a campaign for Trees New York called "Plant a Seed for a Greener Apple." Jeanne was tasked with developing a campaign for a non-profit of her choice for an honors class. Lee chose Trees New York, a non-profit that resides in lower Manhattan and promotes the preservation, pruning and protection of trees in The Five Boroughs. </p>
			<p>Lee chose a simple, direct campaign that would engage the natural beauty of the trees in New York City to promote the non-profit's efforts. She created die cut billboards in the shapes of iconic New York structures such as the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, and the New York skyline. Some of the billboards are set against the natural backdrop of parks while others are set against prints of trees like the one that decorates a tour bus that circles the city. </p>
			<p>"I chose to design a campaign for Trees New York because I believe in the cause and feel that the city needs to preserve and grow more trees," said Jeanne Lee. "I decided to go with a simple design that would use the natural backdrop to get the point across. This is the first time I've ever entered my work for an award, and I'm thrilled that Corbis and the ADC are recognizing my efforts."</p>
			<p>The Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award is Corbis' global signature community relations program. Corbis also supports hundreds of creatives working on projects for non-profit groups by waiving licensing fees for Bettmann images used in those campaigns.</p>
			<p>"It's great to see a company like Corbis recognizing more than great creative work, but great work that makes an impact," said Myrna Davis, Executive Director, Art Directors Club. "The winners of the Corbis award are a fantastic demonstration of what creatives can do to make a difference and raise awareness for important causes."</p>
			<p>The work considered for the Corbis Creativity for Social Justice Award was comprised of winners in any on-profit category in the ADC competition including advertising, design, interactive media and hybrid in any form of media including print, out-of-home, integrated campaigns, television, guerilla marketing, interactive media, annual reports, brochures, publication design, packaging, photography and illustration. The winners in the professional and student categories were chosen by a hybrid jury made up of jury chairs and selected members from advertising, design and interactive media juries. </p>

		<EventDesc>Corbis Enhances Offering To Better Serve Interactive and Mobile Markets</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Innovative Image Licensing and New Collection Help Advertising, Marketing and Editorial Professionals Create Interactive and Mobile Work Easier and More Cost-Effectively</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (April 12, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced industry-leading Rights Managed (RM) licensing enhancements and a new RM and Royalty-Free (RF) Backgrounds &amp; Objects collection to better serve the needs of marketing and editorial professionals creating online and mobile campaigns and editorial content.  The innovations are already making it faster, easier and more cost-effective for creative professionals at leading interactive advertising agencies such as Digitas as well as corporations and media companies to obtain the visual content they need to bring their ideas to life.</p>
			<p>Corbis is adding new packaged options to its existing RM licensing model to streamline licensing content for advertising and broadcast channels associated with the Internet, incorporating Web-only video commercials, Webisodes and mobile device advertisements.  In addition, Corbis is combining traditional television commercial usage with web and mobile uses so advertisers can more cost-effectively extend broadcast campaigns to the Internet and mobile devices.</p>
			<p>"In the past, when we wanted to license a "˜hero' image for broadcast as well as interactive use, we would most likely have to have two sets of RM licenses," said Lisa Oropallo, Associate Director of Art Buying, Digitas.  "These new enhancements make it easier for us to extend the use of an image from broadcast campaigns to the Internet, saving us both time and money."</p>
			<p>Corbis is also introducing a rich and diverse RM and Royalty-Free (RF) Objects &amp; Backgrounds collection created for online advertising, marketing and editorial use.  It is a centralized easy-to-search collection of more than 30,000 images of common objects and backgrounds typically used for e-cards, screen savers and web dÃ©cor including metaphors, backgrounds and galleries.  It is a conceptual collection with a wide variety of both creative execution and subject matters.  The imagery is clean, often on white backgrounds, with subject matter that is easy to cut out and quickly add on a webpage or in a small size. Corbis will continue to add thousands of new images on a quarterly basis.</p>
			<p>"The advertising and media industries are transforming rapidly, and Corbis has been working closely with creative and editorial professionals to understand their emerging needs," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis. "We are committed to being at the forefront of innovation, and we've carefully tailored these offerings to ensure we're providing creative professionals with the right imagery and pricing that they need to succeed." </p>

		<EventDesc>Corbis Announces Plan to Promote Gary Shenk to CEO </EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Long-time Leader Steve Davis to Transition to Senior Advisor Role to Make Time to Pursue New Challenges</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (April 10, 2007) - </b>Corbis today announced that effective July 1, 2007, Gary Shenk, President of Corbis, will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer.  After 14 years with the company, 10 as CEO, Steve Davis will transition out of a day-to-day role to pursue new leadership opportunities in the public service and philanthropic world. The company announced a carefully planned transition process, endorsed by Corbis' Chairman Bill Gates, to ensure that there is a smooth and orderly transfer of Davis' daily responsibilities, and the company said that Davis will continue to serve as a senior advisor beyond June 2007.  
      </p>
			<p>"I want to thank Steve for his tremendous contributions to Corbis," said Bill Gates, Chairman, Corbis. "Corbis was created as much by Steve as by me, since he and I first collaborated when the company was in its infancy.  Steve's vision, entrepreneurial skills, industry leadership and global management capabilities have transformed it from one of the earliest internet startups, to a global brand with industry-leading growth and services.  Today, Corbis has become the definitive creative resources company helping creative professionals in advertising, marketing and media to succeed in bringing their work to life." 
      </p>
			<p>"Gary is a natural leader and an ideal person to assume the role of CEO," said Gates.  "He has the energy, focus, discipline and proven track record to maximize Corbis' assets by further improving business operations and fostering innovation to best serve customers." 
      </p>
			<p>Today's announcement continues a leadership succession process that has been underway for more than a year. As part of the plan to ensure strategy and knowledge transfer, Shenk was promoted to President of Corbis in November, 2006, assuming oversight of marketing, sales and the creative services businesses including rights and music clearances, rights representation, artist representation and media management.  As Corbis proceeds with the smooth transition plan, all Corbis officers will report to Gary in his role as president, effective today. 
      </p>
			<p>"The opportunity before us has never been greater," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis.  "We have strategically invested in acquiring and creating the best pictures, built the most comprehensive rights services offering and expanded our presence and brand globally.  We are well positioned to be the creative partner of choice to our customers around the world and to take Corbis to the next level."
      </p>
			<p>Shenk is widely recognized for emphasizing a customer-focused approach to Corbis' business. Since joining Corbis in 2003, Shenk has been instrumental in repositioning Corbis' image licensing business to achieve rapid growth and attain quality leadership in the creative photography market, while expanding a strong editorial and entertainment offering.  He has also been the driving force behind Corbis' industry-leading rights services offerings.
      </p>
			<p>"This was a hard decision for me," said Steve Davis, CEO, Corbis. "I'm very lucky to have many different interests and passions that I feel are important and challenging, and now is the time for me to explore those other interests. As I prepare for this change, I firmly believe the road ahead for Corbis is brighter than ever." 
      </p>
			<p>With Davis' long history of community volunteerism, playing significant leadership roles in organizations such as the PATH, United Way, NPower, Technology Alliance, Fred Hutchinson, Lambda Legal Defense, Seattle Foundation and many others, he looks forward to dedicating more professional energy in this sector.
      </p>
			<p>Prior to joining Corbis, Shenk was a founder and general manager of FlixMix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Universal Studios that was one of Hollywood's leading media licensing agencies. Shenk's entrepreneurial talents served him well in Hollywood, where he was instrumental in establishing new licensing formats and brokering deals between studios and talent agencies. Shenk began his relationship with Universal while he was a leader in the media and entertainment practice of The Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Among his other accomplishments, Shenk holds an M.B.A in Finance from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and a B.A in Social Studies from Harvard College.  Shenk, 36, is married with three children.
      </p>
			<p>Corbis, founded by Bill Gates in 1989, provides the industry's richest array of creative resources for advertising and media professionals including creative, editorial and entertainment image and footage licensing, rights and music clearances, rights representation, artist representation and a hosted media management solution.

				<b>LOS ANGELES and SEATTLE (April 3, 2007) - </b> Polsky Films today announced that it has licensed through Corbis the exclusive rights to the life story of Albert Einstein from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and also has licensed rights in Einstein's writings and personal letters from Princeton University Press.  Polsky Films, headed by Alan and Gabe Polsky, will produce the first-ever epic motion picture focused on the personal triumphs and tragedies of Einstein, the man who redefined the limits of creativity and imagination.  Polsky Films also announced that Walter Isaacson, former managing editor of TIME Magazine, CEO of CNN, and author of <u>Einstein: His Life and Universe</u>, has signed onto the project as a consultant.  
      </p>
			<p>
Recognized as <i>TIME</i> magazine's "Person of the Century in 2000," Einstein was among the first true global celebrities, and his accomplishments forever changed the course of history and science.  The film will explore the personal struggles felt by a man that the entire world would later look to as an icon, despite Einstein's reluctance to acknowledge his own legend.  A modest man who was aware of his weighty status, Einstein once quipped, "I am no Einstein." 
      </p>
			<p>"We are honored to be entrusted with telling the story of this amazing individual who has had such a great impact on humanity," said Alan Polsky, Polsky Films.
</p>
			<p>"We are grateful to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Princeton University Press, and Corbis for allowing us to share with the world the complete story of Einstein's profound and inspiring life," said Gabe Polsky, Polsky Films.  "This is a great responsibility, and we will do what it takes to make sure this story is told in a truthful, creative and powerful way."
</p>
			<p>Albert Einstein was one of the founders of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, today a leading Research University. Today's announcement reflects an endorsement of the project by both The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the beneficiary of Einstein's intellectual estate and holder of Einstein's intellectual property rights, and Princeton University Press, which oversees the rights to Einstein's collected papers and letters. The comprehensive deal with Corbis includes consultation with leading experts on Einstein, including the Albert Einstein Archives of the Hebrew University, which holds the personal and scientific papers of Einstein. 
</p>
			<p>"We are confident that Polsky Films is the right team to bring Einstein's story to life because of their incredible passion for and understanding of Einstein," said Martin Cribbs, Director of Rights Representation, Corbis.  "Over the years, we've received a number of inquiries, but Polsky Films' proposal was the one that truly captures the essence of Einstein, an amazing yet complex individual. We are looking forward to having Polsky Films help bring the whole story of Einstein to the big screen."
</p>
			<p>Isaacson, whose book <u>Einstein: His Life and Universe</u> is to be released by Simon &amp; Schuster in April 2007, has signed onto the project as a consultant to provide biographical insight, accuracy and integrity for the film.  Isaacson's biography on Einstein will include information from the 3,500 pages of letters that were recently released by the University, twenty years after the death of his stepdaughter.
</p>
			<p>Corbis exclusively represents Einstein's personality rights on behalf of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and manages the rights for more than 40 other iconic celebrities such as Steve McQueen, The Wright Brothers and Liberace.  In addition to his genius, Einstein's personal appeal, irreverent personality and thoughtful perspective have drawn appeal from every industry and ad sector.  He ranked in the top five of Forbes' list of highest earnings by deceased celebrities in 2006. 
</p>
			<p>Polsky Films most recently announced teaming with Pressman Films to Produce Chris Buckley's "GOD IS MY BROKER" with scribe Peter Himmelstein attached to adapt.

		<EventDesc>Corbis Cruises into the Australian Market</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Global CEO and Australian Sales Director introduce company's creative resources to local advertising and media professionals </i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SYDNEY (30 March 2007) - </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) officially launched last night, 29 March, in Australia at Sydney's Cruise Bar.  Global CEO Steve Davis joined Australian Sales Director Sarah McCarthy on Sydney's shores to celebrate the occasion, together with more than 150 media, advertising and publishing professionals.  
      </p>
			<p>
Corbis entered the Australian market in October 2006 with the acquisition of image licensing company Australian Picture Library (APL). Corbis now has offices in Sydney and Melbourne, the later of which will officially launch 19 April, helping to expand the company's reach to 24 offices around the world.  With a focus on the advertising, publishing and media industries, Corbis is committed to providing creative resources to the Australian market including creative, entertainment and editorial image and motion licensing, rights and music clearances, artist representation for assignment photography shoots and a Media Management solution.</p>
			<p>
The launch event showcased a selection of creative photography including imagery produced to meet the specific needs and requirements of the Australian market.  Corbis represents some of the highest quality photography including iconic images from its famed Bettmann and Sygma archives, Playboy and the Andy Warhol collection as well as leading celebrity portraiture via its acclaimed CorbisOutline offering.  Corbis also has cutting edge creative imagery from BloomImage, Image100, zefa and other collections.  Corbis is also actively acquiring and producing its own fresh imagery, adding more than a half million images to its collection in 2006 alone. 
      </p>
			<p>
At the event, Corbis also showed the band U2's "Window in the Skies" video, a stirring montage that features about 100 archival clips of various musicians performing in concert.  In the video produced by Modernista!, the footage has been carefully edited so that the performances sync up with U2's lyrics and music.  Corbis was instrumental in clearing publicity rights for many of the artists represented in the video to help produce it on schedule.  
      </p>
			<p>
Commenting on the company's Australian launch, Davis said, "Corbis is an established global leader in our industry, and we are committed to bringing creative professionals in Australia a fresh choice for imagery and rights services as well as superior customer service.  There is a wealth of creative talent in Australia, and ultimately, we are here to help people do great work." 
      </p>
			<p>
Drawing on 20 years of experience in advertising, McCarthy is leading Corbis' entry into Australia.
      </p>
			<p>"It's great to be supported this evening by Steve and by so many from the marketing and advertising industries," said McCarthy.  "The digital age brings with it so many challenges yet so many opportunities, and we are committed to working in partnership with Australia's creative industries to continue to develop inspiring and exciting campaigns."

				<i>Corbis Signs Mark Heithoff and OlÃ¹gbÃ¨nrÃ² Ogunsemore for Artist Representation</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>NEW YORK (March 19, 2007) - </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced that it is now representing critically acclaimed photographers Mark Heithoff and OlÃ¹gbÃ¨nrÃ² Ogunsemore in North America.  The award-winning photographers, both recognized for their unique styles and insightful perspectives, will work with some of the most recognized marketers and advertisers in North America. The announcement reflects Corbis' emphasis on expanding and diversifying its Artist Representation roster with exceptionally talented and creative photographers to meet the creative needs of commercial and media clients.  
      </p>
			<p>
       "Mark and OlÃ¹gbÃ¨nrÃ² are destined to make a significant impact in the world of advertising in the year ahead," said Lisa Soboslai, Vice President of Artist Representation, Corbis. "They each have an enviable passion for their work that is expressed in their distinctive, emotive styles. Corbis is delighted to work with such accomplished and creative photographers who undoubtedly have tremendous futures ahead of them."</p>
			<p>
Heithoff was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN, and he has worked as a freelance photographer in New York City since 1999. His work focuses on environmental portraiture, and it is his subtle, low-key approach that makes him stand out. His subjects vary from emerging artists to celebrities, business icons, and successful figures from all walks of life. His work has appeared in many publications including New York Magazine, Details, Esquire, ESPN Magazine, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times Magazine. Heithoff was included in the American Photography Annual in 2000-2003, and Photo District News named him a Rising Star in 2000.

			<p>
"I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Corbis," said Mark Heithoff.  "It is an honor to join such a talented community of photographers and one of the most prominent Artist Representation groups out there today."  
      </p>
			<p>
OlÃ¹gbÃ¨nrÃ² was born in Detroit and spent ten years of his childhood in his family's native Nigeria, where he first became interested in photography. He moved back to the United States to pursue his dream of being a great photographer, first in Washington, DC and then in New York City. OlÃ¹gbÃ¨nrÃ² focuses on environmental and studio portraiture in his work, and since moving to New York, he has concentrated on music and sports personalities for commercial and editorial clients. His concentrated attention on color and environment feature an intensely focused subject, setting his work apart in the market. His clients include Adidas, Puma, Dell, and ESPN Magazine. 
      </p>
			<p>
"I've worked hard for this opportunity, and it's great to see my photography be recognized by Corbis and the advertising and editorial communities," said OlÃ¹gbÃ¨nrÃ².  "By working with Corbis, I look forward to more exciting projects that expand the reach and impact of my work and bring the ideas of talented creatives to life."

		<EventDesc>Corbis Selects Location for Preservation of Renowned Sygma Collection</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Treasured Archive Will Move to New World-Class Facility Outside Paris, France to Ensure It Remains Safe and Accessible for Future Generations</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE and PARIS (February 21, 2007) - </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced that, beginning in 2008, the Sygma collection will have a new long-term home at an advanced, climate controlled preservation facility to be built near Paris, France.  The announcement is the next phase of Corbis' "Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative," a project that began in 2004 to ensure that the collections' 50 million objects including slides, negatives, prints and contact sheets are carefully protected in a secure, climate controlled environment while being brought to life and made more widely accessible.
      </p>
			<p>
       "Corbis is committed to investing in the preservation of the profoundly important Sygma archive, one of the greatest collections of photojournalism in the world and an invaluable historical record of many momentous events from the past half century," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis.  "We are proud to undertake this preservation and access initiative to ensure that this visually stunning, iconic collection is safely conserved, highly accessible and can be shared with people around the world." </p>
			<p>
Corbis is collaborating with Locarchives, a proven specialist in archiving and document management, who will build the new "living" archive dedicated specifically to the Sygma collection.  It will be located in Garnay, approximately 45 minutes outside Paris, making it easily accessible for photographers, researchers, historians, iconographers and others professionals interested in consulting the archives in person.  The eight hundred square meter facility will have approximately seven thousand meters of shelving in a climate controlled, airtight environment with advanced fire safety and security protections.  Once opened, the site will be managed by Corbis.  
      </p>
			<p>
Since 2005, a dedicated team of Corbis editors and archivists has been undertaking the initial phases of the "Sygma Preservation and Access Initiative" leading up to the move of the collection.  This has involved changing the archive classification system to classify pictures by photographer rather than by theme to regularize royalties, promote the collection and make it accessible to the public via the digitalization of prints.  
      </p>Next, since the imagery within the Sygma collection is the property of each photographer, Corbis has been contacting the more than 10,000 contributors to offer them an archive agreement confirming that they wish to participate in the archiving and commercial development of their works.  
      <p>Lastly, Corbis is collaborating closely with the photographers to bring the collection to life by searching, identifying and digitizing the most significant photos from the collection to be available via the Corbis website.  Since 2002, Corbis has digitized more than 55,000 pictures to bring the total number available online to 800,000 from the collection. 
      </p>
			<p>The Sygma archive is comprised of nine separate collections of unique photos from the second half of the 20th century.  The 1950s and 1960s imagery includes photography from Apis, Universal Photo, Interpress, Spitzer, Reporter AssociÃ©s and other agencies.  The collections from the 1970s and beyond includes the prestigious photojournalism, news, magazines, celebrities and portraits from the Sygma photo agency, as well as television and movie set imagery from Kipa, and sporting events from Tempsport.

"We're excited to enter the microstock space, and we view it as an attractive, complementary business given our assets and expertise.

		<EventDesc>Corbis and Thunderdog Studios Announce New Creative Partnership</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>"Thunderdog Collective" Will Feature Work from Street Art, Graphic Design, and Illustration Artists and Will Be Available Exclusively Through Corbis</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>New York City (December 18, 2006)-- </b> Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced the launch of a new partnership with Thunderdog Studios and its President and Creative Director, Tristan Eaton, a New York-based artist.  Eaton will act as curator for the newly formed Thunderdog Collective, engaging artists from the worlds of street art, graphic design, illustration, urban vinyl and designer toys to create new works to be licensed exclusively through Corbis.
			</p>
			<p>The announcement was made at a V.I.P. launch and charity fundraising event at The Showroom NYC in New York City's East Village on Friday, December 15th.   At the event, a mural created by Eaton at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in June, 2006, as well as a number of designer toys, were auctioned off, with proceeds benefiting Americans for the Arts, the nation's leading nonprofit organization for advancing the arts in America.
			</p>
			<p>"I'm thrilled to continue working with Corbis to develop groundbreaking, creative works of art," said Tristan Eaton. "It's important for the artists in the Thunderdog Collective to have the creative freedom Corbis provides as well as the opportunity to reach a broader audience." 
         </p>
			<p>The Thunderdog Collective is an initiative to cultivate a growing number of progressive artists worldwide who are creating emerging genres of art that are increasingly gaining widespread recognition. Through this partnership, Corbis provides members of the Thunderdog Collective with access to new platforms for innovation and distribution, including digital mediums such as the internet and mobile, to leverage the rapidly changing world of advertising and media licensing.
         </p>
			<p>The first ten artists included in the Thunderdog Collective span the globe, from New York, to Paris to Japan.  In addition to Tristan, the roster of artists contributing to the Collective include Filth, DEVILROBOTS, Superdeux, Persue, 123 Klan, Demo, Dr. Revolt, Mysterious Al, and Tes One. 
	    </p>
			<p>"As outsiders and innovators, the artists highlighted in the Thunderdog Collective are examples of artists that cross multiple mediums and are redefining the art world today with collaborative works in painting and designer toys," said Ross Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer, Corbis. "This partnership provides artists the room to create innovative work, the ability to make their work accessible to a broad community of creatives and consumers, and the security of copyright protection."
		</p>
			<p>More than three hundred new and original images will be available for advertising, editorial and product licensing, starting in January, 2007 exclusively through Corbis.  Hundreds more will be created and added to the collection every few months throughout the year from both famous names within the community as well as new up-and-coming artists.  The collection will demonstrate the breadth of style and creative innovation among leading contemporary artists immersed in the culture of street art, toy design and emerging art mediums.  The distinct styling of these artists will continue to evolve as artists in the Collective explore new forms, techniques and topics. 
         </p>
			<p>Work from the Thunderdog Collective will be on display at The Showroom NYC (<a href="http://www.theshowroomnyc.com" target="_blank">www.theshowroomnyc.com</a>) from December 15th through January 15th, alongside the mural that was auctioned at the opening event to benefit Americans for the Arts.
         </p>
			<p>"We appreciate Tristan and Corbis demonstrating their commitment to advancing the arts by donating the proceeds of the auction to Americans for the Arts," said Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts. "The funds will go to programs that encourage an appreciation and understanding of the arts that benefits us all."

		<EventDesc>Corbis Names Gary Shenk President</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<i>Promotion from SVP of Images Validates Corbis' Continued Growth and Future Direction</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Seattle (November 28, 2006)-- </b> Corbis today announced the appointment of Gary Shenk as President. Shenk's promotion from SVP of Images is a validation of Corbis' strategy and an explicit step toward becoming an organization focused on industry leadership and operational excellence. Shenk's new role is part of a broader realignment of the company's go-to-market functions into an integrated team, and he will assume oversight of marketing, sales, and the creative resources businesses.            </p>
			<p>During his tenure with Corbis, Shenk has earned a reputation as an industry visionary with the passion and operational skills to transform and grow successful businesses. Most recently as SVP of Images, he has overseen Corbis' image licensing business. Previously, Shenk led the growth of Corbis' industry-leading Rights Services offering.  
			</p>
			<p>"Gary brings exactly the right combination of industry experience, entrepreneurial energy, and operational intensity that will enable Corbis to maintain its position as the fastest-growing major company in our business," said Steve Davis, CEO, Corbis.  "Under Gary's capable leadership, we have significantly improved our product quality and execution in Corbis' image licensing business. It is only natural in this intense competitive environment that we expand Gary's role to drive our complete range of go-to-market activities." 
         </p>
			<p>In addition to his new responsibilities as President, Shenk will continue to direct Corbis' image licensing business including product management, strategic partnerships and photographer relations. Shenk will continue to report to Davis, and assumes some of the responsibilities formerly held by him in his dual role as President and CEO.  
         </p>
			<p>"Corbis thrives on creativity and with the greatest assets and the most talented people in the industry the opportunity before us is awesome," said Gary Shenk, President, Corbis. "With strategic focus, a tight integration of critical go-to-market functions, and overall operational excellence, we are in a great position to lead the industry in fulfilling our customers' needs for imagery and creative resources around the globe." 
	         </p>
			<p>	
Prior to joining Corbis, Shenk was a founder and general manager of one of Hollywood's leading media licensing agencies, FlixMix, a wholly owned subsidiary of Universal Studios. Shenk began his relationship with Universal while he was a leader in the media and entertainment practice of The Boston Consulting Group.  At BCG Shenk developed a digital distribution strategy for the world's leading music company. Shenk's entrepreneurial talents served him well in Hollywood, where he was instrumental in establishing new licensing formats and brokering deals between studios and talent agencies. It was this success that led Corbis to recruit Shenk for its Rights businesses in 2003. Shenk led the new Rights Services unit of Corbis and executed a series of further acquisitions and business development successes that helped to reposition the company as a full-line creative solutions firm.
         </p>
			<p>	
In 2005, Shenk took over the management of Corbis' core image licensing business, where he spearheaded a transformation from an editorial focus to a combined editorial/creative offering. Under his leadership, Corbis has emerged as a leading provider of world-class historical, editorial, and creative photography. Among his other accomplishments Shenk holds an M.B.A in Finance from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and a B.A in Social Studies from Harvard College.

		<EventDesc>Pioneering Artist Collaborates with Corbis on New Rights Managed Original Works and Limited Edition Prints</EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<b>Seattle (Thursday, October 19, 2006)-- </b>New York-based, breakthrough artist Tristan Eaton has created a new series of original Rights Managed (RM) works exclusively for Corbis. First previewed at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival, these works are now available for licensing exclusively at Corbis.  Eaton is the President and Creative Director of Thunderdog Studios, a New York based creative agency and toy label, and recognized as a talent that moves across multiple mediums from graffiti art to commercial illustration to toy design.
         </p>
			<p>
			In the spirit of collaboration and creative freedom, Corbis invited Eaton to explore the possibilities when given access to play with Corbis Royalty-Free (RF) images.  The results of his exploration will be revealed over the coming weeks through the Corbis "˜Feel Free' promotion.
			</p>
			<p>
			To commemorate this collaboration, Corbis commissioned Eaton to create a series of four limited edition silk screen prints on metal. When Corbis customers spend $450 on any combination of Royalty-Free images and CDs between October 4th and November 30th, they will receive one of the silk-screen prints, which will be released once every two weeks throughout the program. Customers will receive the print in release at the time they make their qualifying purchase.
            </p>
			<p>
			"Corbis is excited about collaborating with Eaton on the new RM collection and character designs.  We also saw a fun opportunity to showcase his talent and get a fresh perspective on the creative freedom that Royalty-Free licensing provides," said Steve Davis, President and CEO of Corbis.  "With Royalty-Free licensing, Corbis provides a high-quality, cost effective tool to aid creatives in the development of new, original work. The works that Tristan created from our RF Collection are great examples of what's possible when talented creatives work with our Collection.  And, just like our clients across the world who use RF in their campaigns, the creative can make the image their own. In doing so, the creative establishes both their visual mark and their copyright over the work."  
            </p>
			<p>
			 In order to provide more control over image quality, Corbis has focused on growing its RF library, organically. In the first six months of 2006, the company acquired 90,643 RF images, of which 16,364 are wholly-owned. 
            </p>
			<p>
			  "Corbis places a premium on providing the highest quality, most geographically relevant Royalty-Free images in the industry. We have invested in regional production teams in the United States, Europe and Asia to ensure that the images are relevant to customers on a global basis," said Gary Shenk, senior vice president of images at Corbis.

			</p>
			<p>
Laurel and Hardy's steady rise from humble vaudevillian beginnings to international, slapstick comedy movie stars has given them a lasting legacy that symbolizes partnership and the American dream.

			<p>
				<i>Corbis Rights Representation to License Playboy Imagery</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SEATTLE (September 04, 2006)</b> "" Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>), today announced the addition of iconic imagery from Playboy Enterprises Inc. to its diverse offering of digital media content. This is the first time Playboy will allow a visual solutions provider to license its imagery for commercial use.  The unique and original content will be available through Corbis beginning September 5, 2006.  The collection, which combines retro images that reflect the brand's rich heritage with contemporary classics, includes illustrations, pictures of Hugh Hefner and Playboy Bunnies, as well as lifestyle images.
			</p>
			<p>
Playboy has a long legacy of tradition and style that is exuded in their images. Each illustration and photo in this nostalgic collection conveys the Playboy style that defined the times. Corbis Rights Representation is able to offer that to a broader audience seeking to evoke the Playboy lifestyle in their own creations, while maintaining the standards that Playboy Enterprises, Inc., is always careful to protect.
			</p>
			<p>
"Playboy sets the gold standard as an international consumer brand. Their images are classic, iconic, fun, and connect with people in the same way Playboy always has," said Gary Shenk, senior vice president of images at Corbis. "We're thrilled to partner with Playboy, making the images available around the world."
			</p>
			<p>
"We take protection of the Playboy brand very seriously," said Christie Hefner, Chairman and CEO of Playboy. "This is the first time we've allowed a partner to represent our imagery to the trade for commercial use. It was critical to us that we chose the very best licensing partner for this amazing collection of imagery. Corbis has a global reach into editorial and commercial markets and they have an established, respected brand. This partnership with Corbis gives us a meaningful opportunity to tap into new, important markets."
			</p>
			<p>
Playboy and Corbis plan to celebrate the initial licensing agreement at the Victor Hotel in Chicago on September 7 with a party and sneak preview of the collection. The majority of these images are illustrations, with the balance being the lifestyle iconography and images of Mr. Hefner and Playboy Bunnies.  Additional images are expected to be added to the collection in the coming months.
			</p>
			<p>
Christie Hefner and Corbis' Chief Creative Officer Ross Sutherland will both attend the event.  Commenting on the new agreement, Sutherland said, "These images are classic and fun.  They have a retro appeal that really puts us in touch with a globally recognized style and tell a great story about a unique period in time.  They are a natural fit for Corbis which has the world's largest collection of iconic imagery."
			</p>
			<p>
"Playboy established a precedent for impressive images in their category and no other company has built such a well recognized brand with so many facets for delivering their product," he noted.
			</p>
			<p>
Ms. Christine Santiago, Playboy's 2003 Playmate of the Year, will also attend the collection viewing.

			<p>
				<i>Convergence of Hardware, Software and Content Propel Company Toward New Markets and Profitability</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>NEW YORK (March 14, 2006)</b> "" At its third Annual Meeting with Bill Gates, Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today unveiled its vision for the future of the professional image market and digital media. The Annual Meeting is the one time each year that Microsoft Chairman and founder Bill Gates steps forward to publicly talk about his other company Corbis.
			</p>
			<p>
Founded in 1989 with the purpose of exploring the potential created by combining the internet with digital media, Corbis today is a global leader in image licensing and related services. The company's early vision and exploration have been the foundation for building out a unique suite of services that manage a complex merger of art, commerce, technology and rights. 
			</p>
			<p>
"We have been building Corbis for a long time with the goal of expanding the possibilities for content created by the convergence of technology and media," said Bill Gates, Corbis owner and founder. "Corbis is now uniquely positioned to capitalize on these new and emerging content markets. 2006 is the year to watch Corbis."
			</p>
			<p>
The proliferation of new media and marketing channels creates a new paradigm for the advertising, marketing and publishing industries as they seek digital content that is compelling and cost effective." said Corbis CEO, Steve Davis. "In 2005 we doubled our global footprint and rounded out our content and service offering. As a result we are the only company in the industry with the ability to provide comprehensive solutions""great content, the rights to use it, and the ability to manage it."  
			</p>
			<p>
Corbis reported 2005 revenue in excess of $228 million, a 34% increase over the $170 million in 2004. While these numbers and activities are significant the investments Corbis chose to make and shortfalls in expected revenues forced them to push out their profitability goal.
			</p>
			<p>
In 2005 Corbis invested in the expansion of its global footprint from 11 to 20 offices in 14 countries. This expansion was complimented by five strategic acquisitions that round out Corbis content and service offering: zefa visual media, the German stock photography company that is known for its cutting edge fashion imagery; the Roger Richman Agency which represented the estates of 50 iconic personalities including Albert Einstein, Steve McQueen and May West;  image100 a UK based company that produces royalty free images; eMotion a leading digital asset management solution; and finally Corbis acquired the shares of its joint venture partner, Amana, in Corbis Japan.

		<EventDesc>Corbis Assignment Photographer Lynsey Addario Wins Fujifilm Young Photographer's Award 2005 </EventDesc>
		<EventText>
			<p>
				<b>Perpignan, France (2 September 2005)</b> "" Corbis assignment photographer Lynsey Addario has been awarded the Fujifilm Young Photographer's Award for "The Wounded," her coverage of medical treatment of American soliders injured while serving in Iraq.  The award was presented at the 17th annual Visa pour l'Image international photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France.  
         </p>
			<p>
"This award is important to me on a personal level because it validates my work as a photojournalist," said Lynsey Addario, Corbis assignment photographer.  "Often I go long stretches working without much feedback from a broad audience, so it's very inspiring to have these images recognized in such an important international forum."
         </p>
			<p>
"Lynsey is part of the new generation of photojournalists that are reflecting today's changing world with responsibility, humanity, and talent," said Maria Mann, Worldwide Director of News Photography.  "Her win of the Fujifilm Young Photographer's Award is a tribute to her commitment and dedication to the profession."
         </p>
			<p>
Addario, exclusively represented by Corbis, photographed the series in November 2004 at hospitals at the Balud Air Base and in Landstuhl, Germany and at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, DC.  The winning photography series, originally commissioned by LIFE Magazine, was published in the The New York Times Magazine in March 2005.
         </p>
			<p>
Photographs from "The Wounded" are available upon request.
         </p>
			<p>
				<b>About "The Wounded"</b>

Addario began the assignment for LIFE Magazine at the Air Force Theater Hospital at Balad Air Base.  She accompanied troops on a cargo plane bound for a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, finally arriving at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, DC. The number of casualties had increased exponentially due to the US military's assault on Fallujah, counter-insurgency operations, and insurgent attacks throughout the country. The New York Times Sunday Magazine published a portfolio of the work in March 2005. 
         </p>
			<p>

				<b>SEATTLE, Washington (July 12, 2005)</b> "" Corbis (<a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">www.corbis.com</a>) today announced a series of moves to solidify the company's position as the second largest global provider of imagery and related services to creative and editorial business users. The 3-part announcement includes the launch of "rf SHOP," a new royalty free website on corbis.com, the signing of numerous leading content partners including Jupiterimages, MedioImages, and Blend, and the acquisition of image100, an established London-based royalty free production business. 
         </p>
			<p>
"Clients in every segment, including advertising/design agencies, corporate marketers, and publishers, use royalty free imagery for projects that benefit from flexible use and perpetual rights," said Jennifer Hurshell, Corbis' senior vice-president of commercial image licensing. "Demand in this image category has seen healthy growth in tandem with rights managed content types, and we are meeting that demand with our new rf SHOP, showcasing nearly 200,000 richly diversified professional-grade images." 
         </p>
			<p>
Corbis' rf SHOP (<a href="http://www.corbis.com\rf" target="_blank">www.corbis.com\rf</a>) launches today, aggregating Corbis' entire RF offering and providing customers with enhanced search capabilities, improved seat licensing, and industry leading 3-click checkout. RF photography collections from Corbis, image100, MedioImages, Blend, Image Source, Brand X, Goodshoot, DEX and others are available for immediate licensing, and Jupitermedia's Thinkstock and Comstock collections are coming soon. 
         </p>
			<p>
image100 has been one of Corbis' most successful content partners for several years and adds approximately 40,000 wholly-owned images to the company's royalty-free collection as a result of the acquisition. Russell Glenister, CEO and co-founder of image100, joins Corbis as vice-president of creative content production, reporting to Hurshell. Glenister is charged with growing Corbis' proprietary image production via creative hubs in New York, London, and Hong Kong, and will collaborate closely with Carolyn Guidoin and Siri Vorbeck who continue to lead the sourcing of Corbis' creative imagery from top-tier commercial photographers and filmmakers around the world.

AppleÂ®-A-Day included a unique mix of print, online, and guerilla marketing tactics, including double page spreads in 30 global trade and fashion publications, sidewalk art, posters, boxes with Corbis branded apples, heat-activated coffee mugs, tee shirts, and daily teaser emails. These tactics were executed in United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong.
         </p>
			<p>
Created by Corbis' agency-of-record, Bondo &amp; Remer (Seattle), AppleÂ®-A-Day was successful on multiple fronts.  During the two-month campaign, Corbis added more than 40,000 new accounts, average daily log-in traffic increased by 300%, and research requests increased by 30%.  From this rise in customer activity, AppleÂ®-A-Day generated incremental 2004 revenue from new customers exceeding $6MM. 
         </p>
			<p>
"The AppleÂ®-A-Day Giveaway Contest campaign was designed with a single objective, to interrupt the patterns and habits of creative professionals and encourage them to form a new habit "" starting their day with Corbis,'' said Joe Barrett, Corbis vice president of marketing. "I always ask "˜So what?' when designing marketing activities, and creatives told us by their change in behavior and spending that AppleÂ®-A-Day was a resounding success."
         </p>
			<p>
"Our goal for Apple-A-Day was simple -- to get customers to logon to the Corbis website first thing each morning.  By creating that habit, we felt we could increase top-of-mind awareness of Corbis when those customers were actually looking for images,'' said Dave Remer, CEO and creative director, Bondo &amp; Remer.  "The strategy worked, and at the same time, it reinforced the Start Here tagline while maintaining the playful voice of the brand."
         </p>
			<p>
The team credited for the campaign included: Joe Barrett, Corbis vice president of marketing; Robson Grieve, Corbis director of marketing; Dave Remer, CEO &amp; creative director, Bondo &amp; Remer; Chris Harwood, creative director/copywriter, Bondo &amp; Remer; and Andrea Jones, vice president of strategy &amp; client services, Bondo &amp; Remer.

			</p>
			<p>
				<b>NEW YORK (January 19, 2005)</b>""Corbis, a leading provider of complete visual solutions, announced today that its 2004 revenues surpassed $170 million. The announcement was made at the company's annual meeting, at which Corbis CEO Steve Davis and founder Bill Gates addressed an audience of more than 350 media and publishing executives, journalists and industry analysts. 
         </p>

Corbis reported $170.4 million in revenue, representing growth of approximately 22% over 2003 revenues of approximately $140 million.

"We have experienced strong growth across all our lines of business. Our strategy of offering complete visual solutions, encompassing existing imagery, rights services and assignment and representation, has gained tremendous traction with the market.  2004 revenues are the highest in Corbis history," said Davis. "Today's creative professionals want exceptional imagery combined with the services necessary to use them in innovative ways""which is why more advertising and publishing clients start with Corbis for their visual projects then ever before."
